# About the Album Cover Collection

Starting on 2021 October 25th, I have begun to start exporting music videos into audio-only format. I will still keep the original videos, but these smaller audio files will be more portable, and easier on my current laptops CPU (my current laptop has poor video drivers, and can't even play a still image video without high CPU usage)

The thing that inspired me most to do this was the metadata customization ability in VLC, especially the ability to add/download custom album art.

This directory aims to be a quick reference archive place for every album cover across the entire collection. It is still a work in progress, as of 2021 Wednesday, October 27th.
