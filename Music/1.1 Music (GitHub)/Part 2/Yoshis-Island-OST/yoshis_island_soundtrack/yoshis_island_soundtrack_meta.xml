  <description>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island[a] is a 1995 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). To reunite baby Mario with his brother Luigi, who has been kidnapped by Kamek, the player controls Yoshi, a friendly dinosaur, through 48 levels while carrying Baby Mario. As a Super Mario series platformer, Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving puzzles and collecting items. In a style new to the series, the game has a hand-drawn aesthetic and is the first to have Yoshi as its main character. The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump and produce eggs from swallowed enemies. &lt;br /&gt;</description>
