    <reviewtitle>Beautiful soundtrack</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Yoshi's Island is one of the greatest SNES games, and part of its appeal is its wonderful soundtrack.

However, I note that the ending theme here appears to be cut off and, therefore, stops abruptly. Otherwise, this is a very nostalgic soundtrack.</reviewbody>
