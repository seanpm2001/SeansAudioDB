A spotlight comes up on the Pianoman -- a typical bar lounge guy, rings on fingers, bald with a comb-over. He has a mid-90's looking synth setup doing drums, strings etc; he plays a shiny black baby grand. Intro to "Starlite" is played with much fanfare. More lights come up slowly, revealing three people at the bar -- an older woman in a provocative dress, a poorly dressed drunk, and our protagonist, Thisone.

_Pianoman: Welcome, my friends, to the Starlite lounge -- where music is magic, and magic surrounds us every day. 

{time=27.5}
_NOACTOR:
This evening I bring you a cougar, past her prime; a lifelong alcoholic; and a young man deep in contemplation of his place in the Universe. 

{time=39.5}
_
A perfect setting for the magic of music, which is, as I have said (and now I repeat, in case you weren't listening:) simply Starlite!

{time=57}

Morashon... oy, what a cad. Anyone remember that getup?

Let's not forget the soap!

All lights fade as a spot comes up on Thisone at the bar, twirling a stick in his drink. Music segues again

{time=85}

_Pianoman:
And now, for something completely different -- and yet strangely familiar. Observe, the old standby, when you get right down to it, everybody has one -- or knows somebody who keeps one in their pocket. I present to you, the evergreen perennial -- a Broken Heart.

{time=104}

Song: "Prisoner"

_Thisone:
When I
Was younger
When I was much
Younger than today

_NOACTOR:
I knew
The answer
I knew the score
I knew what to say to you
or anyone at all

_
And if you dropped the question
I would grab the ball

{time=142}

_
Now I'm
Much older
Now I can see
Things I missed before

_
One world
One vision
I'm not so sure
I can give you answers 
that will fit inside your brain

{time=170}

_
I can't predict your actions
I can't feel your pain


{nudge=5}
_
There's a prisoner deep inside me
There's a feeling I can't let go free
This emotion I used to know
One moment I can't let go

{time=190}

_
Back when I flew wild and crazy
No one ever could stand before me
I used to feel oh so free
Now there's a prisoner in me

{time=200}
_
My life
Keeps moving
My heart beats still
I keep pushing on


{nudge=-1}
_
My flesh
Is willing
My will is gone
I can't answer questions 
that don't fit inside my brain

_
I can't describe my feelings
I can't share my pain
Oh oh

{time=237}

_
(hope)        There's a prisoner deep inside me
(feelings)   There's a feeling I can't let go free
(child)        This emotion I used to know
(despair)    One moment I can't let go

_
(flourish)     I thought I could touch the morning
(meaning)   Nothing ever would stand in my way
(nothing)     I used to feel oh so free
(just)           Now there's a prisoner in me

_
(heaven)      There's a prisoner deep inside me
(money)       There's a feeling I can't let go free
(bloodless)   This emotion I used to know
(protection)  One moment I can't let go

_
(questions)    One time when I felt so lonely
(answers)      A miracle set my heart free
(forgiveness) I knew what I had to be
(pain)            I saw the prisoner in me

Scene: Starlite Lounge.  Same piano guy (with a bit more hair), playing the same intro. As the piano lead-in finishes, a small, green, ogre-like creature about three feet tall climbs out from under the piano, picks up a cordless mike, clambers up onto the piano, and begins to sing. His voice is improbable.

{time=338.2}

_Pianoman: Hello again, my Starlite friends. Here to serenade you, I present our little green singing machine. His grammar may be questionable, his hygiene debatable; his ego is quite inflatable, and yet his spirit soars, unabated.

Song: "Starlite"

_Ogre:
It was a starry night
In mid July
We were a lonely girl
A lonely guy
A lonely star was passing by
Starlite was touching you & I

{nudge=2.5}
_NOACTOR:
We told the Moon, be still
And light our way
We told the Earth to stop
And hold the day
We told the Sun to stay away
We told him Starlite was OK

_Something is strange
Something has changed
Starlite has turned to day

{time=439}

We see Annai, a young woman, sipping a drink at the bar. Thisone is two stools down.  They make eye contact.

{time=443}

_Annai: Why are you looking at me?

_Thisone: You look nice.

_Annai: How would you know?

_Thisone: I don't.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: That's right, you don't.  We don't know anything.

_Thisone: Here.

{nudge=2}
_Annai: Here, (waving hands) anywhere.

{time=461}

_Thisone: Then why do we bother?

_Annai: What else is there?  To do, I mean.

_Thisone: I don't know -- you must have a life.

_Annai: I must?

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: Why do you answer everything with a question?

{time=475}

_Annai: I don't.  (plays back her own voice saying: "That's right, you don't.  We don't know anything.")  Don't you pay attention?

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: Try to.  It's hard.

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: What's hard?

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: Paying attention.  Sometimes, it's hard to focus.

_Annai: Huh.. Do you have ADHD?

_Thisone: Not diagnosed, but probably, yeah.

_Annai: They have drugs for that sort of thing.  You should look into it.

{time=498}

_Thisone: Maybe I will.

{time=505}

(music picks up tempo and fades into background)

{time=515}

_Annai: I like this song.  It's a bit sappy.

_Thisone: Yes, quite a bit.  Interesting chord progression.

_Annai: You like music, then.

_Thisone: I like some music.  I'm picky.

_Annai: Morashon?

_Thisone: More a -- what?

_Annai: Ack.  You don't get out much.

_Thisone: That's true.  I've been heads down for months.  Big project.

_Annai: Let's go!

(Grabs her coat and heads for the door)

_Thisone: Go where?

{time=539}
{hold=6}
_Annai: Come with.

{time=548}
{hold=25}
We see Thisone and Annai at a rave-like show in a large venue. Big crowd. Morashon is on the stage; he has many heads and arms, plays multiple instruments, DJ's, and sings. His skin is a sickly greenish hue.  Music starts with a staccato beat.

{time=568}

Song: "Changing Time"

{time=574}

_Morashon:
If you try to dance to this
You may find things quite amiss
You may find that things will change in time
Turning sour the taste you thought was fine

{nudge=-2}
_NOACTOR:
I can't tell you what you know
I can't show you where to go
I can't say what you will have to do
I can't teach you how to best be you

_If I say to think out loud
Stars in trees and sunset cloud
Will your brain begin to understand?
Is it just the pair that makes the man?

{nudge=-3}
_Can you hear me talk to you?
Can you tell me what to do?
Can you let me go my merry way?
Nothing happens to disturb your day

(Annai is transfixed -- light plays on her face)

{nudge=-1}
_If I let you dance to this
You may find your only bliss
You may realize that you're feeling fine
Happy now, contented for all time

_If I teach you you're OK
Will you thank me every day?
Pour a drink and toast it to my name
Keep my memory alive in fame

_Nothing can prepare you for
What you'll see behind that door
No my friend, I cannot take you there
This is not a thing that two can share

_If your mind can dance to this
You might feel that hidden kiss
Then you'll know how we all change in time
Wind that blows in may just blow your mind

_Ooh, ooh, changing time
Ooh, ooh, changing time

{time=741}
_Thisone: So what is this? A DJ? A group? Some band? Umm, what?

{time=747.75}
_Annai: What.

{time=749.25}
_Thisone: What?

{time=750.75}
_Annai: (playing back recording of Thisone's voice) "So what is this? A DJ? A group? Some band? Umm, what?"  

{nudge=-2.5}
_What.  He's a what.

{nudge=-.5}
_Thisone: Meaning?

_Annai: AI.  Emergent neural.  Newest thing.  Programmers from Finland.

_Thisone: You telling me this isn't someone's music?  It's not some guy with software or retro gear, uploading?

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Nope. Code.

_Thisone: Bullshit.

{nudge=0.5}
_Annai: Believe what you want.  Hit the site, it all checks out.  I reviewed the source.

_Thisone: You code?

_Annai: 'Course I do.

_Thisone: I code too.

{time=784.5}
_Annai: Of course.

{time=786}
_Thisone: Well, I don't buy it.  I think it's a hoax.  No software package could come up with something like this.

_Annai: Like you said, you've been offline.  Accelerondo.  You blink, you miss.

_Thisone: Yes, but this?  Last I checked, they were just cracking contextual NLP.  No one has shown an integrated personality worth a shit.

{hold=10}
_Annai: Emergent, self-modifying code; exponential hockey stick.  Let's dance!

{time=815}

{nudge=-3}
Music has shifted to a danceable beat. They dance.  

{nudge=4}
{hold=12}
Suddenly, Annai grabs Thisone by the hand and leads him to a VIP area.  A burly bouncer recognizes her, nods as he pulls back the velvet rope.  A horde of avatars mills about, hoping to enter.  The bouncer gives them the eye; no one else passes.  The bouncer has some sort of force gizmo that keeps them from getting too close to the door.

{time=830}
{hold=12}
Annai and Thisone pass through into the VIP area. We see fancy dressers, smoking cigarettes with long holders, hookahs; some make out, some sip drinks.  Some are dancing to their own music.

{time=839.5}
_Thisone: Where are we going?

_Annai: Meet the man.

_Thisone: I thought you said he was an it.

_Annai: Yes, but 'it' likes to be called a 'he'.  It's his choice, right?

_Thisone: OK... I guess I've never thought about it.

_Annai: Lots to think about, friend.  Got a name?

_Thisone: Thisone. (he pronounces it "Tee-sewn") Spelled like, "this one".

{time=859.5}
{hold=10}
_Annai: Annai. (she does a polite curtsy, offers her hand.  He kisses it, awkwardly)

{time=862}
{hold=20}
They come to a curtain, watched over by a severe-looking woman in a dominatrix outfit.  No one is bothering her to come through; people wait around nervously, hoping to catch her eye.  Annai waits patiently, until the dominatrix flicks her a barely perceptible nod.  She pulls Thisone through the curtain.
Morashon is holding court.  His hands hold drinks, cigarettes, weapons.  He is carrying on multiple conversations with different heads.  One of his heads extends on a prehensile neck towards Annai.

{time=875}
{nudge=-2}
_Morashon: Annai, Annai, my life, my love!  How divine of you to come.  You are fetching as always!

_Annai: Same old, same old.  Haven't tuned my av in ages.  This is Thisone.

_Thisone: (shakes a hand) spelled "this one".

_Morashon: This one?  Or that one?  Which one is it?  Hehehe.  What a name.  What's in a name?  What are you, friend or foe?

_Thisone: Just a fan, I guess.  A new one.  I like your music.

_Morashon: He likes the music!  Wonderful.  Delightful.  Meaningful!  Insightful, so they say.  I refuse to read my own press.  It's all nonsense.  Right, Annai?

{nudge=.5}
_Annai: I suppose.  Thisone doesn't believe in you.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Doesn't believe?  That's rich!  But here I am.  Seeing is believing, isn't that what they always say?

_Thisone: I just said I was skeptical that you were code.  Whatever or whomever you are, I quite like what you do.

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: Ahh...  Whomever, indeed.  Good grammar is so rare these days.

_Thisone: No offense...  It just seems likely that you are the result of a few talented people writing music, and hacking up a cool avatar.  You could be controlled by three or four people with custom sensors.

{nudge=-3}
_Morashon: Ahh...  Indeed, indeed.  That I could.  How would we differentiate?  Do you favor epistemology or ontology?  That is the real debate.  If a musician plays an achingly touching melody, alone in a forest, is it still beautiful?

{time=970}
_Thisone: Well, yes, I think so.

_Morashon: Good answer, good answer!  Annai, I like.  I think he's good material.

{nudge=1.4}
{hold=4}
(Annai chuckles)

_Thisone: what?

{nudge=1.65}
_Morashon: Thisone, please meet us later.  It's so -- public here.  There's so much more to discuss.

_Thisone: well, sure, I guess.

(Annai sends Thisone a text message with the time and location)

{nudge=.5}
_Annai: Here's the coords. (she suddenly disappears)

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: That was a bit rude.

_Morashon: She's still learning.

_Thisone: Learning what?

{time=997}
_Morashon: We all have something to learn, my friend.  Excuse me, there's an old acquaintance I can no longer avoid.

Thisone wanders towards the curtain

{nudge=1.5}
_Thisone: (muttering to himself) Couldn't be that old.  I thought he just came online.

{time=1010}
{nudge=-1}
_Dominatrix: No re-entry.

_Thisone: That's ok.  I've had enough of this scene.

_Dominatrix: So you say.

_Thisone: That Morashon fellow, is it true he's an AI?

_Dominatrix: Whatever.  I just work the door.

_Thisone: Oh, you're a bot too.

_Dominatrix: Whatever.  I just work the door.

_Thisone: That's more like what I'm used to.

_Dominatrix: Whatever.

_Thisone: Right, you just work the door.

_Dominatrix: I just work the door.

Thisone leaves.

{time=1037}
{hold=6}
_Dominatrix: Fucking wethead.

{time=1044}
{hold=12}
Scene: Morashon's salon; it looks like a virtual opium den.  A dozen or so avatars are hanging around, sitting on folded legs or lotus-style on pillows.  Incense burns.  Thisone teleports in.

{time=1051}
_Morashon: Thisone!  Delightful.  We were just about to begin.

{hold=15}
Thisone sits down among the rough circle.  He tries to catch Annai's eye, but she is raptly studying Morashon.

_Thisone:  Annai didn't tell me anything, I just

_Morashon: Nevermind.  We just talk here.  Sometimes I work on my music.  Willing subjects help me tune my parameters.  It's all parameterized, these days.  Please make yourself comfortable.

{nudge=-3}
{hold=25}
Song: "Give It All (To Me)"
Morashon's body is as before, but his skin tone is now chrome.  He begins to sing. He accompanies himself on piano.

{time=1071}
_Morashon:
Give it all to me
Let it all go free
Give me all your dreams
You're bursting at the seams

{hold=25}
As various of Morashon's heads sing a section, his hands reach into each spectator, removing a visual representation of their soul, and placing it inside himself.

_NOACTOR:
Give it all to me
Everything you are
Let me be your guide
I'll be your shining star

{time=1125}
_I gave you hope
I gave you love
I gave you life
I gave you pride

{nudge=-1}
_I gave you strength
To carry on
Give me one
Reason why

{time=1179}
_Give it all to me
Everything you see
Give me what's inside
So I can feel alive

{time=1206}
_Show me now
What it's for
What's at stake
What's the point

_I gave you more
Than you deserve
Give me back
What you stole

{time=1259}
_Give it all to me
Pieces of your soul
Every little thing
Helps to make me whole

_Give it all to me
Everything inside
All will be revealed
When...

{time=1306}
{hold=20}
_There's nothing left to hide.

{hold=99}
By the end of the song, the avatars in the circle appear dead and lifeless; Morashon's chrome body glows with the fire of the collected souls.  

{time=1314}

{time=1380}

As the song ends, Thisone teleports away.
