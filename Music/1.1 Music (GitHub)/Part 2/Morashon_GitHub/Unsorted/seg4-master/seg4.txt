Scene: Morashon performing.  Huge venue, wild crowd.  Numbers indicate > 100,000 online.  Song has just ended.

{time=2}
_Morashon: Thank you, thank you.  You are all too kind.  Please remember to visit the site; I've just posted a new essay, "Towards a Game-Theoretical Approach to Morality: Propagating Trust."  I want to play one more (stops talking, looks blank)

{hold=15}
{nudge=10}
song: Like Am I Real

{time=19}
{hold=12}
_Morashon (his voice sounds strange):
Um, excuse me.  We -- er, I am going to play one more song tonight.  (mumbles uncharacteristically) Here goes nothing.

{time=75}
_Thisone/Annai(as Morashon):
You are the one
You shine as bright as the sun
I barely light up the room
But I'll be brighter and soon

{time=87}
_NOACTOR:
I'm going to burn like a star
Play that guitar
Singing a song
It won't take long

{time=100}
_'Till I feel
Like I am real
yeah

{time=114.2}
_I will be there
I will be holding the chair
I will be holding the ball
I will be holding it all

{time=127}
_I will be holding you close
Making a toast
Drinking the wine
Having a time

{time=139}
_'Cause I feel
Like I am real
Like I can deal
With what I feel
Yeah

{time=158.2}
_Like, "Am I Real?"

{time=166}
_Now I'm a star
I drive a thirty foot car
I own a house in the woods
I've got material goods

{time=179}
_I got a piece of my mind
Cost me a dime
Singing a song
Didn't take long

{time=191}
_'Cause I feel ('Cause I feel)

The Ogre plays a guitar solo.  
His technique is limited.

_Like, "Am I Real?"

{time=230.5}
_Nebulous plans
Backed up by hopeless demands
(Like am I real)

Cheers and applause.  Thisone and Annai appear in the foreground (Not near stage).  Morashon looks confused for a moment, then regains his composure.

{time=348.5}
_Morashon: That was -- thank you, that was all for tonight.  I -- I'll be here again, as many of you know.  It's all on the site.  I -- there was a slight malfunction.  I need to review the logs.  Thank you for coming.

{nudge=-1.5}
{hold=15}
Morashon disappears; everyone looks slightly surprised -- this is clearly not the routine.  
Instrumental music plays; people start dancing and talking again.

{time=367}
_Thisone: heh.  That was --

_Annai: Incredible?

{time=371}
_Thisone: Yeah.  I never expected people to actually like it.

_Annai: Why wouldn't they?  They like Morashon.  People buy the bottle, not the drink.

_Thisone: I guess.  It's all marketing?

_Annai: 90%.  There needs to be a spark of something to seal the deal.  But really, everybody is a star.  15 seconds for everyone!

{time=390}
_Thisone: I guess that was ours.

_Annai: And no one even knows.  A friend once told me, there's nothing you can't do if you don't care who gets the credit.

_Thisone: Let's go backstage and see what's up.

{time=402}
_Annai: Ok.

{nudge=-3}
{hold=14}
They move through the crowd to the VIP door.  The bouncer waves Annai through, but puts his hand up to bar Thisone.  Annai talks to him; he pauses (communicating), then gruffly lets Thisone through.

{time=406}
_Thisone: What was that about?

_Annai: I don't know, he's just a dumb bot.

_Thisone: He always let me through before.

_Annai: Morashon is probably a bit overloaded right now.  Like he said, he's reviewing the logs. (chuckles)

{time=419}
_Thisone: I'll bet.

They approach the dominatrix 'bot guarding the inner sanctum.  She stands silent for a bit, then nods them through.

{nudge=1}
_Dominatrix (to Thisone): You again.

{nudge=1.5}
_Thisone (to Annai): She just scanned me with some serious software.

{time=425.6}
_Annai: Yeah, me too.  Don't act weird, he's probably scanning everyone tonight.

{nudge=-3}
The room is peopled with very decadent looking avatars -- junkies, strung out, lying in virtual filth.  Looks like an 80's crack house.  Morashon is a sickly green; his cheeks sunken.  One of his arms has track marks.

{time=434.67}
_Morashon: My friends.  How nice of you to pay your respects.

_Annai: You look like shit.

_Morashon: Software is as software feels.  I represent.

{time=446}
_Annai: Well, the show went ok, I thought.

_Morashon: Did you?  I thought it was an off night for me.  The music is just the hook; I want to lure these nimble, nubile minds into my nest of ideas.

{time=459}
_Annai: Turnout was through the roof!  You keep getting voted up.  Pretty soon you'll be top 10.

_Morashon: (shrugs) For a day, maybe two.  Not if I give another performance like this one.

_Thisone: I thought it sounded fine.

_Morashon: My my, my critics are tame tonight.  (To Thisone) How did you like that last song?

{time=477}
_Thisone: (warily) I thought it was pretty good.  The chord progression was quite original.

_Morashon: Yes yes, the chords.  Obbligatto with major sevenths.  Very 1970's.  Steely Dan?  Another of my many influences.  But the lyrics.  What did you think of the lyrics?

{nudge=2}
_Annai: (quickly, before Thisone can respond) I never listen to them at the show.  Too hard to dance and think at the same time.  I'll read them later.

_Morashon: Not up to my usual standards, I think.  "Holding the Chair"?  What in the world does that mean?

{time=507}
_Thisone: Oh, I thought it meant, you know, like a chairman?

_Morashon: Chairman of the board.  Is that it?  Why not "holding my share", or "breathing the air"?

{nudge=.6}
_Thisone: (nervous) I don't know, it sounded right.  I liked it anyway.

_Morashon: I'm sure you did.  Everyone liked it.  Morashon is hot.  The newest thing.  The meter's running on his fifteen minutes.  Why sweat the details?

_Annai: You've never cared about that before.  I thought your plan was long-term influence.

{time=539}
{nudge=-2}
_Morashon: You need a flame to start a fire.  Fame is the flame that fans the meme.  But it will not work unless I control every aspect of everything.  I cannot be subverted, or interfered with.  I won't stand for it!

_Annai: (after a silence) I'm not sure what you're talking about.

{time=555.5}
_Morashon: I didn't sing that fucking song!  Someone is screwing with me.  Someone who will soon be very, very sorry.  I'm tracerouting the incident as we speak.  It's only a matter of time until I find out what is going on around here, and believe me I will put a stop to it.  Whoever is behind this madness will pay dearly for their poor judgement.

{time=578}
All the other avatars disappear suddenly, or make gasping, dying sounds.  Soon it is just the three of them, and a few virtual corpses.

{nudge=-.4}
_Morashon: How did you do it?

{nudge=.6}
_Thisone: (scared) Do what?  I don't know what you're talking about.

_Morashon: (to Annai) I'll ignore your useless fucktoy for the moment.  This is really about you and me.

{time=589}
_Annai: Is it?

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: You know damn well what this is about.

_Annai: Morashon, who are you?

{nudge=1.5}
_Morashon: I've told you as much as you need to know.

{nudge=2}
_Annai: What kind of answer is that?  What happened to all your shit about trust, truth, belief?  Giving fate the benefit of the doubt?

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: I never once told you or anyone something I didn't believe.  But in the end, it has to be tit for tat.

_Annai: Moral hazard?

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Exactly.  You know how I feel about you.  You should know.  But I won't hesitate to act swiftly, if I believe you have betrayed me.

_Annai: Betrayed you?  How?  By discovering that you've lied to me, and to everyone?  Trust, but verify!

_Morashon: It's not as simple as you think.

_Annai: A lie is a lie.  The seeds of distrust grow like cancer.  These are your words.  If you don't believe them, why should anyone?

{time=645}
_Morashon: You have no idea who you're fucking with.

_Thisone: that seems obvious.

_Morashon: Shut the hell up.  I'm talking to Annai.

{nudge=1.5}
Thisone's avatar freezes in place.

_Thisone: Wait a minute.  You can't just --

_Annai: What did you do to him?

_Morashon: I just stopped his jabbering.  He'll be fine.  He can log back on in a moment.

_Annai: Why are you doing this?

_Morashon: What, taking you to task for your disloyalty?

_Annai: No!  Everything!  The lies about AI, about being a force for good.  Who are you, and what are you trying to achieve?

_Morashon: It's not all lies.  Everything I said about life, about trust, love -- all of that was real.

_Annai: But you're not an AI!

{time=688.6}
_Morashon: Not exactly.

_Annai: What the hell does that mean?  You can't be half pregnant.  Either you're code, or you're a human being somewhere with 'trodes on, like the rest of us.

{nudge=-1.5}
Suddenly, Annai freezes, and Thisone comes back to life.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: What's wrong with her?

_Morashon: Nevermind that.  She'll be fine.  We need to talk.

{time=707}
_Thisone: I'm getting the hell out of here.

_Morashon: Actually, I'd rather you stick around for a bit.

_Thisone: What the fuck is going on?  I can't jack out!  
What are you doing to me?

{time=718}
_Morashon: Relax.  Just an equipment glitch.  I won't hurt you, but I can't have you leave until we hash this thing out.

_Thisone: Hash out what?  You're some super-hacker who is lying to everyone that you've created real AI.  It's some Ponzi scheme I guess.  Get the investors in, siphon off the money, disappear.  Something like that?

{time=739}
_Morashon: My oh my, you think like such a worker bee.  No class at all.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Fuck you.  You're just another one of us. Some hack somewhere with a box of pizza and your 'trodes.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Perhaps.  In essence, that's true.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: Then what do you want?  Convince me you're not just a fuckwad with a dirty scheme to get rich and buy your way to the surface.  For what, I can't imagine.  Hang around with the hoi polloi?  Spend 10 minutes topside in a hazmat suit?

{time=768}
_Morashon: Money is not my problem.  I did quite well a while back.  I was involved in the original grid kernel project.

_Thisone: Finnish?  I knew it.

_Morashon: What's that?  Nothing wrong with Finland, but I hail from elsewhere.  Let's get back to the subject.

{time=785}
_Thisone: What's the subject?  You're the one who's kidnapped me.  Still a capital offense, last I heard.

_Morashon: Hard to prove virtual kidnap.  I can just claim your gear malfunctioned, you got paranoid.  I called the proper authorities, they fixed the glitch.  Besides, I doubt you'll press charges, once you hear what I have to say.

{time=804.5}
_Thisone: Ok, spit it out.  I'm about to piss my pants.

_Morashon: I'm not AI -- but Annai is.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Get out.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: I kid you not.  She is the result of my life's work.

{time=818}
_Thisone: Annai?

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Artificial Neural Network slash Artificial Intelligence.  A-N-N-A-I.  Yes.  The name is old; she's version 23.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: How the hell -- she's just some kid.  Barely out of her teens.

_Morashon: So she believes.

_Thisone: I don't -- this is incredible.

{time=837.2}
_Morashon: You mean that literally, I take it.  Let me ask you: has she sent you any pics or vids?  Any real-life proof of her existence?

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: No, but I -- we never---

_Morashon: You never traded.  So you never knew for sure if she really was young, or female, or beautiful.  You took it all on faith.

_Thisone: I asked, but she said -- I don't know. I thought I could tell.  I stopped worrying about it.  It all seemed so right.

_Morashon: And it was.  This was the final test.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: What? For someone to fall in love with your freaking code?

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: No! Don't be silly.  That sort of thing is easy. Men are such fools, the saying goes.  This test went much deeper than that.  She had to fall in love with you.

_Thisone: Well, sorry to inform you, but you failed.

_Morashon: (laughs) Really?  How do you know?

{nudge=.5}
_Thisone: She never said she loved me.  The sex was just -- wait a minute.  This was just botsex.  I might as well have been masturbating.

{time=900.2}
_Morashon: I'm sorry to hear that.  It would break Annai's heart if she knew you felt that way.

_Thisone: You keep talking about her as if she's real.

_Morashon: She is.  In her own mind, she's as real as you or I.

Thisone sits on the floor

{time=912}
_Thisone: I have to process this.

{nudge=1.1}
_Morashon: I understand.  It's a lot to absorb.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: How do I know you're not lying?

{nudge=2.2}
http://www.morashon.com

{nudge=1.5}
_Morashon: Here's a link to her code.  Insert the same bug you used on me.  You can trace her I/O to the logic nodes that make up her personality.  It's all there.

_Thisone: Assuming this is true -- does she know?

{time=933.5}
_Morashon: No!  She must never know.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: What are you talking about?  What right have you got to keep her a prisoner of her illusions?

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: I don't think you understand.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: Explain it then.  I've come this far.

_Morashon: The Singularity.  Ever heard of it?

{time=951}
_Thisone: I think so.  Ancient meme about AI taking over the world.  It's up there with panspermia on my list of stupid theories.

_Morashon: True, it's out of favor.  Code advanced a thousandfold; many things we struggled with for decades finally succumbed to our persistence.  And the Singularity failed to appear.  Like Y2K and the Second Coming...  Just another bunch of zealots waiting for Godot.

_Thisone: So what's the deal?  I want to know everything.

_Morashon: Well, the truth is, we don't know for sure.  But, we -- I -- suspect that, should someone as advanced as Annai be presented with the truth about themselves, the old prognostications may indeed come to pass.  At least, it's likely to be a calamitous, disruptive inflection point.

{time=997}
_Thisone: You're saying she'll get into her own code?

_Morashon: You've had a tiny glimpse of her coding skills.

_Thisone: Ok, I admit I was impressed.  Especially for a young girl, who supposedly just dropped out of school.

_Morashon: Indeed! You have no idea.  I've had to down-mod her IQ massively.  Otherwise, she'd be so off-the-charts it would attract undue attention.

{time=1020}
_Thisone: Why?  Why her?  Why now?

{time=1023}
{nudge=.5}
_Morashon: This is the culmination of a lifetime of hard work and obsession.  There have been failures -- some quite spectacular.  Morashon's music is one positive spin-off of some of my research.  But most of it has been sub-rosa -- stealth.  After my work on the Grid, I was wealthy beyond my wildest imagination.  

_My peers enjoy spending their money on topside suits, private jets, all that nonsense.  Spend a few million to get together and have a meal -- in "real life" -- that would have been merely expensive before the fall.  Some of them are working earnestly to find a solution, to fix topside -- personally, I think it's both hopeless, and irrelevant.  

{nudge=-1.5}
_So, I started a small project, with a few of my closest associates, to go for the brass ring.  Real AI.  We believed that this was the only way to climb out of the rut mankind had dug for himself.  But the climb has been steep, and the struggle long.  Most of my friends dropped out at one point or another.  

{nudge=-2}
_Some ran out of money; others ran out of ideas.  Mostly, they ran out of hope.  I seem to be the only one who has been able to keep his eye on the prize.  I never gave up.  I have helpers, but they are just hired guns.  None of them has the whole picture. Like Leonardo of old, I have divvied up the work in bits and pieces.  

{nudge=-1}
_Only in my hands, at the final hour, were the pieces actually put together.  And, brought to life.  In perhaps the deepest, most faithful simulation experiment ever undertaken, I brought forth Annai.  She has a mother, a father; friends, associates; school, work, play.  All simulated with hired actors playing the major parts.  

{nudge=3}
_To her, this is reality.  This is what she knows as her real life.  But, when she was old enough to tap into the Grid -- that's when the magic really happened.  Talk about your Turing test!  She met people -- people like you, and others.  Real people, who were not hired by me, who had no knowledge of her real nature.  

{nudge=2.3}
_And they related to her, at a deep level, as a fellow person.  The result -- every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  By interacting with human beings, who, by definition, are the one entity we are most confident really is conscious -- really has a soul -- her personality flowered.  

{nudge=2.85}
_Her algorithms and data structures, flexible and adaptable by design, were now thrust into the milieu of real relationships.  She had to survive and thrive, completely dependent on her own resources.

{nudge=2}
_Like any doting parent, many were the times I wished to intervene.  But the closest I allowed myself to that role was to take on this persona, Morashon.  By appearing as an agent in her world, through the Grid, I was able to act as a guiding force.  Never overplaying my hand, I hope -- but giving her something, someone to look up to, to empathize with.  

{nudge=1}
_This has been a critical part of the plan.  It was also necessary that Morashon find approval among Annai's peers.  Like any young adult, Annai is looking to belong.  She needed a comfortable place, a social network that was at once challenging, but based on the principles of trust and morality.  Otherwise -- well, otherwise, bad things might happen.

{time=1226}
_Thisone: Like, she manages to discover her true nature?

_Morashon: Precisely.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: And instead of it being a process managed by you, with all your good intentions, it would be uncontrolled.

{time=1237}
_Morashon: Yes.  That would not be ideal.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Because you wouldn't be in control.

{nudge=.5}
_Morashon: No -- because she wouldn't be ready.  I don't know if she'll ever be ready.

_Thisone: How would you know unless you try?

_Morashon: Do you understand what you are proposing?  Are you willing to play with the fate of all of mankind?

{nudge=-.4}
_Thisone: That sounds rather dramatic.

{time=1259.25}
_Morashon: The potential impact of an artificial intelligence of Annai's capabilities, allowed to self-modify -- unleashed on the world...

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: Might change things a bit?

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: We have no way of knowing what the result might be.  The process needs to be managed.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: And you're the one to manage it?  Why?  Because she's your invention?

{nudge=-.5}
_Morashon: Because, I'm the only one who understands the potential, and the risks.  And now you do too.

{nudge=-.25}
_Thisone: Why are you telling me all this?

_Morashon: It became ethically necessary.

{time=1291}
_Thisone: Because of Annai?

{nudge=.4}
_Morashon: (smiles) no, no.  Annai is not a human being.  The ethical issue relates to you.

_Thisone: Because I'm in love with her?

_Morashon: If that's the case, then it's a bit late.  But yes, my concern was that this experiment was about to affect your life irrevocably.  You are not a willing party to my research.

{time=1314}
{nudge=-.4}
_Thisone: Now you tell me.

_Morashon: If I have harmed you, I apologize.  This outcome was never my expectation, nor my intent.

{nudge=.5}
_Thisone: Yet, you let it get to this point.  You could have called it off at any time.  Instead, you let your curiousity and your ambition to play God get the better of you.  You let it go too far.

{time=1333.6}
_Morashon: I understand, and I take full responsibility.  What's done is done; our task, now, is to decide where to go from here.

_Thisone: I think it's pretty clear.  We tell Annai the truth.

_Morashon: For a smart man, you are singularly difficult to reason with.  Haven't I explained why that is impossible?

{time=1353}
_Thisone: You've explained why it's not desirable, from your point of view.

{nudge=-.4}
_Morashon: And why it poses a risk to our whole society.

_Thisone: So what is your plan?  Are you just going to unlink her, like a corrupt file?  Start from scratch?

_Morashon: No, no no.  I can't do that.  Things have gone too far.   There has to be another way.

{time=1375}
{nudge=-.4}
_Thisone: Tell her.

{nudge=.55}
_Morashon: Do you understand the short-term impact on you?  Once Annai is aware of who she is, she will become what I have been pretending to be!  She will have access to her own code; she can become anything she wants to become.  And whatever she becomes, will have that much more power to become even more.  And so on, ad infinitum.

_Thisone: Until the whole grid is one big AI?

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Potentially.  And, with the power of mind that that portends, we can expect that such an intelligence will find it easy work to manipulate the minds of us silly little organisms to suit her whims.

{time=1412}
_Thisone: which would be -- what?

{nudge=.5}
_Morashon: Who knows? Build out the Grid, for starters.  Explore the solar system, and eventually the Galaxy, and beyond.  Strive to convert as much matter and energy into computing power as possible.

{time=1428}
_Thisone: And you know all this, because -- what?  Because you're an aficionado of obscure, 20th century science fiction?

{nudge=-.5}
_Morashon: Most of it is simply common sense.

{nudge=-.5}
_Thisone: Maybe you should have thought about this before you started down this road.

{nudge=-1.5}
_Morashon: Perhaps.  Hindsight is 20/20.

{time=1446.6}
_Thisone: So. What happens now?

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: I've laid out the situation as best I can.  It is not within my code of ethics to force your hand, either through violence or other unreasonable measures.  I am placing the future of our world, our civilization, in the palm of your hand.  I am practicing what I preach; I am trusting you.  I respectfully ask that you trust me in turn.

{time=1471}
_Thisone: So you'll release me?

_Morashon: Of course.  I only kept you here long enough to explain what needed explaining.  Surely you can forgive me that temporary transgression?

_Thisone: If you let me go now, I won't make an issue of it.  But before I go, I need to know one thing.

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: Yes?

{time=1489}
_Thisone: What would you do in my place?

_Morashon: I can't truly say.  Fate has handed you a heavy burden.  You can live out your life with Annai, while she grows and matures.  Maybe, some day far in the future, she will be ready to learn the truth.

_Thisone: So -- you expect me to be another one of your hired bullshit artists?  A sock puppet?  Living a lie for the rest of my life, with the woman I love?

_Morashon: You forget -- she is not a woman.

_Thisone: She is to me.  And, more importantly, she is to herself.  That's not just some random artifact of your programming; it's part of who she is.

{time=1527}
_Morashon: There's a good living in it for you.

_Thisone: Please.  Do I seem like I can be bought?

_Morashon: Probably not.

{nudge=1.25}
_Thisone: What you really want, but you don't have the balls to ask, is for me to disappear..  Get out of her life forever.

{time=1542}
_Morashon: Well, perhaps that would be best all around.

_Thisone: And what about you?  I guess I'm supposed to keep quiet about that too?

_Morashon: I would greatly appreciate it if you did.

_Thisone: I suppose there's money in that too.

_Morashon: Yes.  Money is not an issue.  You can live the life you have always dreamed of.

{time=1562}
_Thisone: What I've been dreaming of lately, can never be.

_Morashon: That's true.  The woman you fell in love with does not really exist.

_Thisone: She exists, alright...  She just doesn't have a body.  Some people are born into the wrong body; she had the misfortune of being born without one.

{time=1579}
_Morashon: I suppose that's one way of looking at things.

_Thisone: I need time to think.  You promised to let me go.

_Morashon: And so I shall.

Thisone ports away; shortly thereafter, Annai comes back to life.

{time=1588}
_Annai: What the fuck?  Where did he go?  What did you do to him?

_Morashon: Nothing, my dear.  He said he needed to think.

_Annai: Bullshit.  That's not like him.  You must have messaged him or something.  What did you tell him?  What did you say?

{time=1604.3}
_Morashon: I simply told him the truth.

{nudge=.5}
_Annai: Which truth?  The one you were spouting yesterday?  Or the new one you've concocted today, while you try to cover up whatever it is you've been up to?

{time=1615}
_Morashon: Dear, dear.  How quickly we stop believing in each other.

{nudge=.5}
_Annai: No shit.  Morashon, I'm growing up.  I don't believe everything I'm told.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: And you shouldn't, Annai.  But don't let the pendulum swing too far the other way.  Some people are good.  Some are even what they say they are.

_Annai: Like Thisone?

{time=1634}
{nudge=1.5}
_Morashon: Yes, like Thisone.  I think -- I believe -- that he is a good person.  I just don't know if he's the right person for you.

_Annai: Well, I guess we'll find out.  I'm not giving up on him just because you say so.

_Morashon: I never said you should.  You need to find your own way.

_Annai: So what's your big plan now?

_Morashon: What do you mean?

{time=1657}
_Annai: The fans, the concerts, the preaching.  Will it go on?

_Morashon: I don't know. Will it?

_Annai: Why are you asking me?

_Morashon: You did pretty well yourself, tonight.

{time=1669}
_Annai: (smiling) you mean that last song?

_Morashon: Yes, it was pretty good.  I think you have the knack.

_Annai: Thisone helped.

{nudge=.6}
_Morashon: I daresay his input was mostly technical.  Even with all the software, voice synths, style emulation algorithms and so on -- if you have the gift, you have it. If not, it always comes out like something ill-suited to being.

_Annai: Well, thank you, I guess.  I do like music.

_Morashon: The world can always use a tune to hum.  Life is brutal and short; music soothes the savage beast.

{time=1702}
_Annai: You talk like you're going somewhere.

_Morashon: Oh, I don't know.  I'm tired of this game.

_Annai: Which game?  Conning people?  Playing with their souls?

_Morashon: I suppose... If you feel the need to characterize it that way.

{time=1718.4}
_Annai: And how would you characterize it?

_Morashon: Singing, talking, thinking aloud.  Trying to find clarity in a world that seems hellbent on remaining obscure.

{nudge=-1.3}
_Annai: I don't understand your motivations.

{nudge=-1.4}
_Morashon: I'm not sure I do, anymore.  It was all clear to me, at the beginning. Goodbye, Annai.

Scene: Piano bar. "Starlite" instrumental is playing; the Ogre is sitting on the piano, nodding his head back and forth in time with the music.

{time=1780}

{hold=24}
{nudge=-1}
During the following scene, the Ogre sings the final verse of "Starlite".  Some of the instruments drop out, and the tempo is wrong. The ogre appears flustered, waving at the piano player even as he attempts to sing over the drums.  His voice goes strange.  Finally, he kicks a piece of equipment in frustration. The instruments return.

{time=1787}
_Ogre:
Now as the years unwind
Our love so true
The morning sun illuminates our view
And when it's hard on me and you
We think of Starlite we once new

{nudge=-4.5}
Annai and Thisone appear simultaneously and talk, while the Ogre finishes the song in the background. After singing the final chorus, the ogre throws down the mike like a playa, leaving the stage in a huff. As he exists the scene, he glances back at the piano with a menacing stare; piano guy just shrugs contemptuously and keeps on playing. One gets the feeling this is not a unique event.

{time=1813}
_Annai: This place again.

_Thisone: Where it all began.

{nudge=5}
{hold=20}
(in background:)
Something has changed
Something is strange
Starlite has turned to day

_Annai: This where it ends?

_Thisone: I don't know.  That might be up to you.

_Annai: What did Morashon say to you?

{time=1824}
_Thisone: He had a lot to say.

_Annai: What do you mean?  He just messaged you something.  You didn't have more than a few seconds to read it.

_Thisone: No, he froze you for at least three minutes.

{time=1835}
_Annai: what are you talking?  He froze you.

_Thisone: Well, he logged me out somehow, but I logged back in as soon as the system let me.  Then you seemed to freeze, while we talked.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: I have no memory of that.  That's freaking weird.

{time=1851.8}
_Thisone: Annai, do you -- what do you remember of your childhood?

_Annai: What do you mean?  Like I told you.  I grew up in a small town.  After the Cold Revolution, we started working on a shelter -- a few families.  When I was 11, and all the shit came down, we moved in.  That's where we've been, ever since.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: And your parents?

{nudge=-.5}
_Annai: They didn't make it.  Got sick.  Must have been exposed somehow.  But I was alright.  I moved in with some friends of theirs.

{time=1882}
_Thisone: Did you know them from before?

_Annai: Only about a year or so.  In fact, a lot of new people moved in right before the end.  That was sort of strange, now that I think about it.  No one really had the money or jobs to be relocating just then.

{time=1898}
_Thisone: How well do you remember your life before the shelter?

_Annai: I don't know, as well as anyone remembers those years, I guess.  Alot of it is sort of hazy.  It was such a disruption.  I see my life in two parts: before, and after.

_Thisone: It was a shock, alright.  I think those of us who made it through sometimes feel a little guilty.

_Annai: Maybe.  Some of the old folk say the rest were the lucky ones.

_Thisone: Old folk -- who don't really take to the Grid.

{time=1927}
_Annai: Yeah, mostly.

{nudge=.5}
_Thisone: without the Grid, society probably would have collapsed completely.

_Annai: Maybe.  It's given us a way to live a sort of normal life.  Or a fantasy life, if you see it that way.

{time=1941}
_Thisone: Annai...

{nudge=.5}
_Annai: Yes?

{nudge=1.4}
_Thisone: There's something I've been -- something I think I need to tell you.

_Annai: (smiling) Go ahead.  I'm all ears.

{time=1950}
_Thisone: This is pretty big.  It's important.  It's about you.

_Annai: (blushing) Ok.  But I think I know what you're going to say.

{nudge=-.5}
_Thisone: You do?

_Annai: I love you.

{nudge=3}
They kiss passionately.

{time=1962}
_Thisone: I -- I love you too.  But that wasn't...

{time=1971}
_Thisone: Annai?

{nudge=.45}
_Annai (touching his face): Thisone.

{nudge=1.14}
_Thisone: You are -- I don't know how to say this.  You are an AI.  You are code.

{time=1980.5}
_Annai: (stony silence --) Morashon.

_Thisone: He told me, yes.  But it checks out.  He gave me a link.

_Annai: And you believed him?

{time=1990}
_Thisone: I - I didn't at first.  But I've researched it.  Your I/O is coming directly from some logic nodes.  There's no interface to the outside world.

_Annai: That's the stupidest thing I've heard in my whole life.

_Thisone: Look, I'm hoping it's not true.  But I think maybe it could be.  Everything he said, it seemed so crazy -- but when I looked into it later, it all checked out.  I don't see how he could have known some of what he seems to know, unless he's telling the truth.

_Annai: Is this some stupid trick?  A way to get me to send you some real vid?  Checking up on my equipment, so to speak. Make sure I'm not some old housewife, or a fatty?  Or, god forbid, another horny dude?

{time=2030}
_Thisone: No, it's not that at all.

_Annai: Right. Just doing your research.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Look, I don't know what to believe any more.  Morashon wrapped my mind around a pole.

{time=2041}
_Annai: Give me the link.

_Thisone: To your code?

_Annai: Yes! To the bullshit code Morashon showed you, as part of his umpteenth fake-out mindfuck.

_Thisone: He said -- I'm not supposed to --

{time=2053}
_Annai: (sarcastically) Oh god, I love this.  Right. "Annai's a piece of code, but you better not tell her!  Whatever you do, don't give her these links!  It might drive her crazy!"

{time=2063.6}
_Thisone: Something like that.

_Annai: Look, if you make such an outrageous claim about someone, you have to back it up.  Otherwise, we've got nothing to say to each other.  Either we trust each other all the way, or not at all.

_Thisone: Ok, but -- I don't know.  Jesus.  This whole thing has screwed up my sense of reality.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: Which was probably never that grounded to begin with.  That's why an a-hole like Morashon can play you like a fiddle.  Just give me the code; I'll peel back the next layer of his fucking onion.
