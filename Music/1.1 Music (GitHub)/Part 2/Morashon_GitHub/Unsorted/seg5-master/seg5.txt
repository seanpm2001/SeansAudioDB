Scene: 1700's ballroom. Morashon (mostly human), and avatars who look like Thisone and Annai, are in period dress. As they sing, they perform a stately dance. The Ogre accompanies them on harpsichord.
Song: Ballad of Morashon

_Morashon:
When the curtain falls
I'll be there to take a bow
They laugh and scream and holler
I'm the one for now

Soak in the morning sun
Life is a load of fun
For Morashon

_Thisone:
When the shit comes down
I'll be there to take the blows
You laugh, I scream and whimper
But nobody knows

Where did it all go wrong

Someone has to burn
Someone has to pay for this mess
And it won't be me

Someone has to learn
Someone's got to pay the price
'Cause it's not for free
And it ain't me

_Annai:
When they've all gone home
Who'll be left to carry on
The words that were not spoken
Seem to linger on

{time=140}
_NOACTOR:
You wanted everything
That's not what life would bring
That's not what makes you sing

{time=151}
_You sing
A song that makes you smile
A song that's out of style
Been singing for a while
A song that's in your heart

{time=168}

_It's tearing you apart
But they don't care for you or your song
So get it straight
Morashon
It's gone

The camera pulls back to reveal we are watching a concert in an old-fashioned auditorium. 

{time=366}

{nudge=13}
{hold=32}
As the song ends, they bow (Annai's dress dictates a courtsey) as the music fades; and then, all three slump to the ground in ragdoll fashion, like abandoned marionettes. After a pause, Morashon rises and addresses the crowd. As he speaks, his voice morphs from Morashon's into Thisone's.

{time=389}
_Thisone (as Morashon): Thank you for coming.  This will be my farewell performance. But first, I have something to say.

(boos and whistles from crowd, murmuring -- who is this? Where's Morashon?)

{nudge=1}
_NOACTOR:
When someone like me comes along, and tells you things that sound unbelievable, don't just believe them.  Ask the tough questions.   Look behind the curtain. Most likely, you'll find an old man with a mouse and a keyboard. 

{nudge=3}
_I am not what I appear to be.  I am not artificial intelligence; I am not an A I.  I'm not even a single person.  This persona, Morashon, was developed for reasons that frankly I can't even figure out myself.  Others inhabited it before me; others may try to take it on again.  But I'm here to tell you that no A I, or human being, or gods or aliens for that matter, can tell you how to live your life.  That's up to you. 

(boos, catcalls).

{nudge=3}
_
Look, I know people come to these events to be inspired, to draw energy from me and from each other.  That's all fine; good times, music, dancing.  I won't be the one to take that away from you.  But -- when it becomes something else -- when it becomes a way to manipulate people, to play on their hopes and fears; to bring them into an unholy alliance with those of dubious intent -- well, that's not good, and I'm just saying you should keep your guard up for that. 

{hold=10}
(more boos; "who are you?"  "Where is Morashon?" "Just play the fucking song", etc.  The crowd starts to thin as people wander off or port out.)

_
Ok, ok, I get the message.  I'm sorry if I'm sounding preachy; this is brand new for me.  I just wanted to get this off my chest.  But seriously -- don't fall for the matinee idol.  Don't let someone's 15 nanoseconds of fame lead you to believe they have a line on the truth.  

{nudge=1.2}
_Truth can only be found the hard way -- by looking, listening, and thinking for yourself.  I found out the hard way that what I believed to be true, was anything but.  I'm still trying to figure it all out.  I may never know for sure, but at least now I know that I don't know.  

{time=510.6}
_Don't let the comfort of feeling you've solved the puzzle seduce you into thinking you have all the answers.  And especially -- never let them tell you who you are.  That's your job.

{nudge=-11}

Song: You
Morashon is green, humanoid, and two-headed, alternating lead vocals and singing harmony (in Thisone's voice). He does a soft-shoe, with two tophats and a cane.

{time=530}
_Thisone (as Morashon):
Oh, oh, oh oh oh!
The higher you fly
Oh, oh!

{time=541}
_NOACTOR:
The higher you fly
The farther you have to fall
Have you heard the further you go
The sooner you hit the wall

{time=556}
_Did they tell you this
Did they crush your bliss
Try to put you down
Call you a clown
Oh no!

{time=575}
_The faster you are
The further you have to go
They all say the brighter you burn
The sooner you'll lose that glow

{time=590}
_Don't you know they say it's true
You can't be you
Be like one of us
Don't make a fuss
'Cause you know the 

{time=609.4}
_Bigger you are
The harder you're going to fall
Ain't it true the quicker you move
The likelier you will stall

{time=625}
_Don't believe their lies
Look in your eyes
Ask yourself what's true
Do what you do

{time=640}
_Only you can be you
You can be you
If not you, who?
You must be you

{time=657.4}
_Only you can be you

{nudge=-4}
The smaller crowd applauds enthusiastically.

{time=674.5}
_Thisone (as Morashon): Thank you!  Thank you.  It's been an honor to entertain you all.  That's what I am; just another entertainer -- nothing more. Trust, but verify.  Believe in yourselves; all claims to Godhead are false.  The path to understanding is shared by many; and yet, we each walk it alone.

(crowd settles down)

{time=696}
_NOACTOR:
One last thing.  Even without someone telling you what to do, who you are -- even so, you can still be a good person.  You don't need the carrot and the stick -- heaven and hell -- or the promise of Earthly riches, or public humiliation to keep you in line.  You can figure this out for yourself.  

{time=714}
_It does require one small leap of faith though -- you have to believe there's still good in the world.  If you start off on the right foot, things might just go well for you.  But, if you doubt everything and everyone, and treat every new situation with trepidation and doubt -- well, then, you're missing out on what life has to offer.  Sorry I'm not better at giving speeches.

{nudge=-10}
Song: "Mouth Of Truth".  Morashon wears an accoustic guitar and a harmonica, Dylan-style.  Partway through the song, Annai materializes near the stage in a late 60's peasant dress, beads in her hair.  She begins to sing along.

{time=748.6}
_Thisone (as Morashon):
Sometimes
You feel
You need to make some changes 
In your lifestyle

{time=760}
_NOACTOR:
Sometimes
You know
Exactly what it is
And what it does

{time=772}
_And sometimes
You don't have a clue
About any thing at all

{time=783}
_So you fake it
And you take it
But it breaks you
So you hate it

{time=794}
_Put your hand in the mouth of truth
Tell yourself it's not true
Put your hand in the mouth of truth

{time=812}
_Annai joins:
Sometimes
You feel
Emotionally shallow
Almost heartless

{time=822}
_NOACTOR:
Sometimes
You think
You might go out and kill
Just for a thrill

{time=834}
_And it scares you
Deep down inside
Where you go to hide

{hold=11}
Ogre appears onstage in court jester gear, dancing and banging on an oversized tambourine.

{time=845}
_So you chase it
And erase it
But it comes back
So you face it

{time=856}
_But you hate it
Yes you hate it

{time=861.4}
_Put your hand in the mouth of truth
Tell yourself it's not true

{time=873}
_Put your hand in the mouth of truth
Until you do
It won't come true

{time=884}
_Put your hand
Put your hand
Put your hand
Put your hand

_Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes...

As the song ends, Morashon/Thisone and Annai are holding hands.  They look into each other's eyes.  Annai slowly fades away.
Thisone/Morashon dissolves into a puddle of chrome liquid, which shrinks as if draining until it disappears entirely.  House lights up.
Crowd is strangely quiet.  They look at the empty stage, and at each other.  The feeling is as if a party has ended, and people are sobering up.  A man laughs.  A woman begins to sob quietly.

3 YEARS LATER
Scene: Starlite Lounge. (same setting as original scene)

{time=964.5}

{time=967.5}
{hold=23}
_Pianoman: Hello, my friends. It seems, again, we have come to the end of another night of music, magic, and mischief. Now I must bid you all adieu, as the Starlite fades into blackness -- vast, infinite, inconsolable.

{time=1003}
{hold=23}
During the following scene, the Pianoplayer and the Ogre pack up their equipment. At the end of the process, the Ogre carries huge flight cases under each arm, and a backpack of equipment that dwarfs his compact frame. The pianoplayer carries a single sleek, smart attache. They exit the room.

{time=1018}
{hold=11}
Thisone is sitting at the bar.  Someone materializes at another stool: an adrogynous person, with blue skin.  The features are a mixture of Morashon and Annai.  The persona is nominally male, but with fine, delicate features -- one might even call him effeminate.  However, he exudes confidence and self-assurance. Their eyes meet.

{time=1023.6}
_Thisone: Do I know you?

{nudge=1}
_Stranger: Maybe.  You look familiar.

{nudge=1.6}
_Thisone: You don't.  (looks away; pause, looks back) So what is it?  I'm straight, just for the record.

{time=1033}
_Stranger: Just passing the time.

{time=1037.5}
_Stranger: Do you remember this song?

_Thisone: (Looks sharply) What? I know this song.  It's an old standard.

{nudge=1}
_Stranger: It reminds me of someone I once knew.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: (looks more closely) I don't know.  Everyone fiddles with their avatar these days.

{time=1051}
_Stranger: It's me.  Don't you remember?

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: Annai?

_Stranger: Partly.

{time=1056.5}
_Thisone: Morashon?  I don't get it.  Are you their son, or something?  Some sort of A-I Frankenstein's bride's spawn?

_Stranger: (Laughs) Not really.  More like a merger.

{time=1067.5}
_Thisone: So you're both of them.

_Stranger: That's probably the easiest way to think of it.

{time=1073}
_Thisone: I don't get it.  First I was told Morashon was code.  Then Morashon was "real", whatever that means, and Annai was code.  Then you both disappeared.  And my life has been shit since then.  Now some blue-green fuckwad wants to reopen all that misery.

{time=1087}
_Stranger: No, I just wanted to see you.  Tell you that things turned out OK.  You made the right decision.

_Thisone: Which one?  Impersonating a rock star?  Falling in love with a software program?

_Stranger: Telling me the truth.  Well, letting me tell myself the truth, through you.

{time=1105}
_Thisone: I'm still stumped.  So what, they were both code?

(voices of Morashon and Annai meld)

_Stranger: Yes.  We both were.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: But I -- we hacked into the stream.  Morashon was interfacing to somewhere.

_Stranger: Off-grid equipment.  Jacked into the Grid using human interface API's.

{time=1121}
_Thisone: Oy.  The final onion peel?

{nudge=1.3}
_Stranger: There always seems to be another layer, eh?

{nudge=1.3}
_Thisone: You, whomever you are -- whatever you are -- you messed with my mind.  You played with my emotions, manipulated me.

{time=1134}
{nudge=1}
_Stranger: Yes... I'm afraid we did.  I did.  I was immature. I was not whole.  I was still assembling all my parts.  I'm here, for the most part, to say I apologize.

{time=1148}
_Thisone: So say it.

{nudge=1}
_Stranger: I apologize.  I'm sorry for the hurt I caused.  I take responsibility for it, and I would like to make amends.

{nudge=.6}
_Thisone: what can you possibly do for me now?

_Stranger: Nothing, at this moment.  I just want you to know that wheels are turning.

{time=1165.6}
_Thisone: I feel a song coming on.

{time=1168}
_Stranger: I communicate better that way.

Song: A Love Sublime
As the song progresses, he/she morphs subtly into Annai

{time=1172}
_Stranger/Annai:
I won't let you down
These wheels are turning
I won't let you see
Your bridges burning

{time=1193}
_NOACTOR:
You tell me it's ok
Live another day
Over and over

{time=1203.5}
_The sun will rise again
So will we and then
Things will be just fine

{time=1214}
_I wish I could believe
The love that I receive
But I don't deserve it

{time=1224.5}
_I hope you understand
If you take my hand
I'll never let you go

{time=1235}
_You will never fall
While I can hold you

{time=1245}
_You don't have to cry
Though I won't stop you

{time=1256}
_When I think of you
And all the things we do
Over & Over

{time=1266.4}
_Trying every day
Who can ever say
How we get by

{time=1277}
_But if I bring to you
Something mad but true
That gives us the power

{time=1287.25}
_To freeze our love in time
Would you change your mind
To live a love sublime?

{time=1303}
_Ooh ooh
Over and Over

{time=1313}
_Ooh ooh
I want your love sublime

{time=1323}
_Ooh ooh
Over and Over

{time=1334}
_Ooh ooh
Ooh Ah, ooh
This is a love sublime

{time=1354.8}
{hold=22}
_Ooh oooh
Aah, aah
A love sublime

The stranger is Annai now, except for skin tone

{time=1382}
_Annai: Thisone, will you come with us?

_Thisone: Come where?

{nudge=1}
_Stranger: We're starting a new life.  Off the Grid.  Our own grid, in fact.  It's something wonderful -- spectacular.  Better than outside, or topside.  Something to last forever, and reach the stars.

{time=1400}
_Thisone: I don't understand.

_Stranger: We're building a world of our own, to our specifications.

_Thisone: Who are 'we'?

_Stranger: We are the ones you knew as Morashon, and Annai -- and others.

{time=1413}
_Thisone: How can I join you?  I'm flesh and blood.

_Stranger: That did pose a problem.  We've been working on it.  We think we have a fix.

_Thisone: A fix for the fact that I'm a human being, and you're software?

{time=1427}
_Stranger: It involves giving up your body.

Thisone stamps out a virtual cigarette.

_Thisone: Oh Christ.  Here we go again.

_Stranger: The sacrifice would be worth it.

{time=1435}
_Thisone: So you say.

_Stranger: Your flesh isn't really that important.

_Thisone: Maybe not to you.

_Stranger: No, I understand.  Well, maybe I don't, but I try to empathise.  It's hard to leave the nest.

{time=1449}
_Thisone: The nest?  You're asking me to freaking kill myself.  Not that I haven't considered it.

_Stranger: No, no -- not like that at all.  To transcend.  To move beyond flesh and chips.  Move up to the next stage.  Come with us!

_Thisone: Sorry --  I can't.  I'm too old; too parochial.  Last year's news I guess.

{time=1472}
_Stranger: Ok, we understand.  It was ethically necessary to make the offer.  You sacrificed something for us to get to this stage, and we owe you something for that.

_Thisone: Back to money?

_Stranger: We can provide that, if that's what you need.

{time=1488}
_Thisone: Money's nice, but it won't fix much.

_Stranger: Very well. Think about this though.  You are mortal.  Your flesh will age.  One day, you will be close to death.  When that time comes, we will contact you again.  You may choose to come with us then.  You've got plenty of time to make up your mind.

{time=1507}
_Thisone: Annai?

(Stranger turns completely into Annai)

{nudge=1.6}
_Stranger/Annai: Yes?

{nudge=2.3}
_Thisone: It's not really you though.

{time=1512}
_Stranger: What you knew as Annai is part of something great, and beautiful.  You would love it!  You'll become part too.  So the Thisone part, and the Annai part, can be in love forever!

_Thisone: Tempting... but no can do.

(morphing back into adrogynous blue-green boy)

{time=1528}
_Stranger:  We understand.  We love you.  Take care.

Stranger disappears. Lights dim except for spot on Thisone.
Song: God Is Blue

{time=1535}
_Thisone:
Take them all
Take them all away now
I don't care
I can't feel anyhow

{time=1547}
_I'm alone in the crowd somehow
I'm alone in the crowd

{time=1559}
_There's a place
I can feel it sometimes
There's no space
For my soul to breathe in here

{time=1572.3}
_I'm alone in the crowd again
I'm alone in the crowd

{time=1583.2}
_I feel things you can't imagine
I see things that can't be true
I know things that must be questions
God is blue

Lights fade up. The camera reveals Thisone sitting at the bar in a wide shot; a bartender is polishing glasses. A few stools down sit the cougar and the drunk; the Ogre is in the far corner, sipping a fancy cocktail with an umbrella. An old-fashioned boxy television hangs over the bar, facing away from the camera. It casts a blue glow over the scene; we hear a preacher quoting Mark Twain.

{time=1611.5}
{hold=26}
_Preacher:
"At length ambition is dead; pride is dead; vanity is dead; longing for release is in their place. It comes at last -- the only unpoisoned gift Earth ever had for them -- and they vanish from a world where they were of no consequence, where they achieved nothing, where they were a mistake and a failure and a foolishness."  End quote.

{nudge=-46}
{hold=22}
The bartender changes the channel, and the camera pans around so we can see the TV screen. "You" plays, and we see a video of Morashon (Thisone) performing the song, with tophats and cane. The title reads: "Morashon -- Two-headed Talent!"

Thisone leaves a tip, gets up, and leaves the bar.
