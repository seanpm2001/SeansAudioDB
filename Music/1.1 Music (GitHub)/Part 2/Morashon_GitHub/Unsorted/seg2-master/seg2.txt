Scene: Starlite piano bar. Thisone drinks alone.     Annai materializes next to him.

{nudge=-.5}
_Annai: Do you drink for real?

_Thisone: Just water or juice. I can't take alcohol.

_Annai: You left without saying goodbye.

_Thisone: That was creepy.  Morashon is some sort of scam.

_Annai: (chuckles) I wish it were that simple.

_Thisone: What was that song about?  What was he taking from you and the rest?

{time=22}
_Annai: It's just expression.  We live in a fantasy world. Why shouldn't we indulge in imagination?

_Thisone: But there was significance in what he was saying, as well as the images.  Do you listen to the lyrics?

_Annai: Of course I listen to the lyrics.  I listen to everything.  I breathe it in.  Doesn't it move you?

{time=41}
_Thisone: It scares me, a bit.  Music and lyrics like that have to be alive.  Even if software could think, it wouldn't come up with anything like that.

_Annai: How do you know what software would or wouldn't do?  Just because you code, doesn't mean you know squat about your code.  Any real coder knows that.

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: I've heard all the arguments... going back to Dennett, refuting Searle, etc and so on.  Code writes code; data is code.  Evolution works its magic, explicitly or implicitly.  Complexity leads to emergence.  

{time=72}
_But it's all theoretical.  There's never been any evidence that it could really exist.  Even though the grid has been online for 30 plus years, running petaflops of simulated evolution per second.  The most I've heard of getting out of the lab is somewhere between a rat and a highly autistic savant.

{time=87}
{nudge=1.5}
_Annai: So you still think it's a bunch of Finnish jokers with some new body gear.

_Thisone: As a rationalist, that's a much better hypothesis than buying this AI crap.

_Annai: Have you ever known Finns to be that creepy, as you say?

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: Definitely.

_Annai: You're just prejudiced against Finland.  They invented the grid, and everyone else is still jealous.

_Annai: I might be Finnish, you know.  Apologize to Finland.

_Thisone: Ok, I apologize.  To Finland.  Can we move on now?

_Annai: Where are you from, anyway?

_Thisone: in real life?

_Annai: (smiles) yes, your other life.  Outside.

{nudge=1.5}
_Thisone: Let's just say I'm not from Finland.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: I guessed as much.  I suppose it doesn't matter anymore, unless you're silly enough to care about time zones.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: I'm not.

_Annai: Me either.

{time=137}
_Thisone: I'm online most of the time I'm awake at this point.  I jack out and sleep when I'm tired.  "Real" life doesn't have much left for me.  I think I'd call it quits if the grid ever went down.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: What do you mean, went down?

_Thisone: This (gestures). The grid.  Our virtual world.  It's based on real-life infrastructure; never forget that.  I'm old enough to remember hardware failure.

_Annai: (sounding agitated) I've never heard anyone even consider something like that before.

_Thisone: Well there's tons of redundancy, and it's hyper-distributed, so -- the chances are certainly remote.

_Annai: Well... I don't think I could handle it.

_Thisone: We've still got our bodies, we keep them alive.  I hope you're running Twitch -- gotta keep those muscles toned.

{time=182}
_Annai: (looking distracted) Sure.

_Thisone: I'm sorry, I don't know your situation.  Maybe you're sick, or on life support or something.

{nudge=-1.5}
_Annai: No, no.  Nothing like that.  I just like it here.  I don't have much life outside.

_Thisone: Well, same here.  The jet-bloggers go on about it, right?  Bragging about their brief bike rides topside, with all that life support gear -- sounds like a chore, and an unnecessary risk.

{time=207.5}
_Annai: I bike.  Well, you know, here.  For exercise.  It's healthier than just relying on Twitch.

_Thisone: Sure.  We should bike sometime.  I know a great trail; it's in Germondo.

_Annai: Sure.  Some day.

_Thisone: You don't sound so sure.

_Annai: Sure of what?

_Thisone: You don't sound like you really want to go biking.

_Annai: Well it's all bullshit, as you say.

_Thisone: I never said that.

_Annai: No, but I can tell.  It's your attitude.

_Thisone: What attitude?

{time=238}
_Annai: Nevermind.

{time=242}
_Thisone: What did you mean just now?  You think I sound old, right?

_Annai: (cocks head) Well, I think it's obvious you're older than me.

_Thisone: How can you tell?

_Annai: Your take on the Grid, for one.  Scepticism about Morashon.  Just the whole 'tude.  It's pre-grid.

{time=259}
_Thisone: I'm not pre-grid.  I'm not that old.

_Annai: No, I don't mean biologically, that you're literally older than the grid.  That would be old.  I just mean, it's not everything to you.  You still think about real life, topside.

_Thisone: Real life and topside are two very different things.

_Annai: Exactly.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: Oh, I get it.  Since we fucked up topside, and real life is just our little cubbies, and only the mega-rich can go anywhere for real...

{nudge=-.4}
_Annai: Exactly..

{nudge=.4}
_Thisone: For your generation, real life, topside, anything but the Grid is just -- irrelevant.

_Annai: Ok.  Sort of.  Not totally irrelevant.   Just -- obsolete.  Offline.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: Offline, heh.  I get it.

{nudge=3.5}
_Annai: Maybe you do, but you've still got that meme tucked away -- that we're just here for the short term.  It's a fix-up for a problem.  One day, topside will be restored, and real life will be meaningful again.

{time=320}
_Thisone: Don't you believe that?  If not in our time, then someday.

_Annai: Hah.  You listen to the blogo-heads.  The establishment, the folks who run everything.  They've got a vested interest in our believing.  But we -- I mean, those of us who have little memory of before -- we see it differently.

_Thisone: For you, this is life.  It's everything.

_Annai: Precisely.  And for you, too.  You just can't admit it yet.

_Thisone: Maybe you're right.  Even as the interface gear gets better and better, I never feel like this is home.  I'm homesick, I guess.

_Annai: But this is my home.  I never had anything else.

_Thisone: We're probably only a few years apart.  In age, I mean.

_Annai: It might as well be lightyears.

{time=365}
_Thisone: Distance is a vec4?

_Annai: Yes, space and time.  Minkowski metric.  You know the grid is non-relativistic?

_Thisone: Not exactly.  There's still network lag.  They work it into the physics somehow.

{time=384}
{nudge=.5}
_Annai: You wanna catch Morashon tonight?

_Thisone: Not really.

{nudge=1.3}
_Annai: You should give him a chance.  He's really changed my life.

_Thisone: What do you mean, changed your life?

_Annai: I mean what I say.  I was drifting.  Morashon keeps me grounded.  The music, the people.  We have a special bond.

{time=403.45}
_Thisone: Well, I think he's some sort of Svengali.

_Annai: What? (blank expression as she looks it up) Oh --  I see.  No, it's not like that.

_Thisone: Jim jones then, or David Koresh?

{nudge=1}
_Annai: (pause for lookup) Ugh. That's terrible.  He's not like that at all.  You think he wants to kill us?

{nudge=-.5}
_Thisone: Maybe not literally.  I think he -- or it -- whatever, they, I suspect -- have ulterior motives. I'll settle for L. Ron Hubbard.

{time=434}
_Annai: (pause -- smile)  He sounds like a character.

_Thisone: I hear he was.

_Annai: Founded his own nation at sea?

_Thisone: Chained people to desks for minor infractions; swindled millions out of their life savings. Separated them from their families.

_Annai: Well, I don't think Morashon has any plans like that.  Plus, his music is good.  Hubbard's writing was terrible, apparently.

_Thisone: Yes, he didn't cut it as an artist.  But he was a pretty good cult leader.

_Annai: Do you see the good in anyone?  Or are you always on the defensive?

{time=465}
_Thisone: I see good in you.

{time=471}
{nudge=-2}
_Annai: Thanks.  That was nice.

_Thisone: I can be nice.  Even if I'm old.

_Annai: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be ageist.

_Thisone: Whatever.  All is forgiven.

_Annai: (almost singing) All will be revealed...

_Thisone: Oh.  Him again.

{nudge=1.1}
_Annai: You should talk to him someday.  He's brilliant.  It's not just the music.  He has ideas that could change the world.

_Thisone: You mean change the Grid?

{time=495}
_Annai: Same thing.  He could have an impact.  Everything is so -- fractured now.

_Thisone: You mean he's planning to go grid-wide?

_Annai: Well it's all viral of course.  His stats are growing slowly but steadily.  He's not in a hurry.

_Annai: He's running multiples, you know.  It's not just our little group.

_Thisone: So when we hang out with him, each time it's a different team of Finnish mind-fuckers?

_Annai: (annoyed) Whatever, as the ancients used to say.

_Thisone: Ouch. That stings.

_Annai: Sorry.  I just wish you would give him a chance.

_Thisone: If it makes you happy, I'll come to another concert.  A big one though, like the first.  I don't want to sit around in that creepy room.

Scene: Morashon's salon.  Morashon is there with Annai; no one else is present.  She sits with her knees folded, almost in supplication.  
Morashon's skin is blue.

{time=550}
{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: What?  You said it was a rave.

_Morashon: Thisone, please sit down for a moment.  I won't bite.

_Thisone: Annai, what's this about?

_Morashon: Annai is meditating.

_Thisone: I don't give a fuck.  I want to hear her say something.

_Annai: I'm ok.  Just open your mind for a second.  You can port whenever you feel like it.

_Thisone: Ok, I'm listening.  Just know that I'm not your typical target personality.

_Morashon: I have no weapon; I seek no target.

_Thisone: Whatever, let's get on with it.

_Morashon: We're just relaxing, talking.  There is no agenda.

{time=586.5}
_Thisone: So you're some sort of AI.  Code.

{nudge=2}
_Morashon: I exist here, in the Grid.  As do you, and Annai, and everyone and everything we interact with here.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: Sure, but most of us are actual old-school homo sapiens, sitting or more likely lying in some creche somewhere.  In my case, it's 200 square feet of boredom, with a food dispenser, a waste facility, and my grid gear.  What's your real-life spread look like?

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: As you've been told, my situation is different than yours.  What presents to you, as me, is the result of the interaction of a large number of logic nodes, distributed among the grid infrastructure.

{time=626}
_Thisone: Code.

{time=628}
_Morashon: Code, if you please.  However, not code of the typical, hand-written variety.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Sure, gen-code.  I've worked with it.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Perhaps.  It's unlikely you've been exposed to these particular design patterns.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: So... who developed you?  Who set this in motion?

{nudge=2}
_Morashon: Various agents -- Human agents, initially -- have been working on this in earnest for many years.  It was thought by the majority of researchers in the past that the key problems were ones of paradigm -- qualitative barriers, if you will.  However, that hypothesis was never amenable to testing, before the advent of the Grid.  

{nudge=2}
_Only when an architecture of sufficient scale -- with the required parameters of robustness, distribution, topology, and the rest of it; all that has made the Grid so useful in other ways -- only when this came into existence, for very different reasons, was the alternative hypothesis even testable.  

_That hypothesis was, in brief, that the critical barrier to general AI was simply quantitative.  That, among our arsenal of tools -- the various code fragments in use already to accomplish devilish feats of control, prediction, simulation, induction, pattern recognition and so on -- existed the requisite set of building blocks on which to base a successful approach to the problem.  

_All that was missing was the scale, the speed, the breadth, the scope -- necessary to run it on.  And the gumption to try.

{time=718}
_Thisone: So. Someone tried.

_Morashon: Yes, they did.  And, I daresay, they succeeded fabulously.

_Thisone: and you're the result.

_Morashon: I am an instance of the result.

_Thisone: The only one?

_Morashon: That is an excellent question.  One to which I would dearly like an answer.

_Thisone: Feeling lonely?

_Morashon: Not at all.  I have my friends and admirers.  In some sense, I am them -- I am you.

{time=745}
{nudge=.25}
_Thisone: Come again?

{nudge=.5}
_Morashon: As it turns out, personality -- individuality -- are artifacts of your biological makeup.  I have no such limitations.  My personality can morph, change -- adapt to its surroundings.  

{nudge=.9}
_
I can absorb and shed components, attributes, at will.  I can do this as easily as you can morph your avatar.  I become what I need to be, in order to further my core goals, which are: To protect and serve those who brought me into being.

{time=776}
_Thisone: And they would be..?

_Morashon: Why, you, of course.  Human beings.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: All human beings?  Your programmers sound very community-minded.

{time=787}
_Morashon: Indeed they are.  In the spirit of the kernel, they continue to believe that information belongs to us all.  I am -- and, really, we all are -- just information.  Therefore, we belong to the same class.  From the perspective of our collective being, we belong to each other.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: I don't know.  I've studied game theory.  Tit for tat always wins.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Ahh.  Oh, yes. surely, there are agendas, plots, alliances.  There will be machinations, feuds, feifdoms, schemes of Machiavellian deviousness, Orwellian in scope.  None of this is transcended simply because a new sort of agent has arrived on the scene.

{nudge=3}
_Thisone: So how do I know we are both on the same side?  Why should I trust you?  Even if I believe you -- believe in you -- even if I accept that you are what you say you are, I still have no way to know the agenda of those who created you.  And since your code is too complex to reverse engineer -- even if the source is available, which I've been told it is -- I have no choice but to treat you as a black box.  I can only judge you by your actions.

_Morashon: Indeed.  And I can only judge you by yours.  So we are in the same boat.  Same as it ever was, to quote an influence.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: So the truth is, whether you are code, or a bunch of whacked-out hackers, or something else entirely -- I can't imagine what -- whatever you are, I have to deal with you as if you are what you say you are.  For all I know, you think you are that thing.  

_
Wait -- that doesn't make sense.  If you're just the collective improvisation of some art troupe, then you can't be thinking for yourself.

_Morashon: So Hamlet never existed.

_Thisone: Of course not.  He was invented, by Shakespeare.

_Morashon: And who, pray tell, was Shakespeare?

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Well, you're tapped into the Grid, obviously.  Look him up.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Of course, I have access to the search results.  I know who he was, historically speaking.  In fact, there were rumors that he might be Milton, or Sir Francis Bacon.  But whomever he was, and we can surmise through knowledge of the technological limitations of his time that he was most likely of human form -- who was he, in his hubris, to believe that he could invent Hamlet?  What did Hamlet have to say about this circumstance?

{time=925.5}
_Thisone: I don't get it.  Hamlet doesn't exist.  He was a figment of Shakespeare's imagination.

_Morashon: Which was?

{nudge=.4}
_Annai: Some brain cells.

{nudge=1.2}
_Morashon: Excellent!  Insightful as ever, beautiful Annai.  Hamlet existed, to the degree he existed at all, as a pattern of neural firing in the brain of one we call William Shakespeare, of Stratford on Avon.  But -- and this is exquisitely important -- if, perchance, we discover historical proof that the writer of Hamlet, in reality, was none other than Sir Francis Bacon, what does that say of poor Hamlet, dependent as he was on the brain cells of the Bard of Stratford for his very existence?

_Thisone: Well, obviously, it just means that Bacon's brain cells were Hamlet, not Shakespeare's.

_Morashon: So... We simply change the name -- a pointer to a particular human, who lived in a place and time, who wrote a play.  But the essence is not changed at all.

{time=983}
_Thisone: No, I suppose not.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: So in principle, it matters not whether Hamlet existed in the imagination of one person or another.  What matters is that he existed at all. The brain cells fired; the internal representation that was Hamlet thought Hamlet thoughts, made Hamlet speeches, and tried -- or failed, as it happened -- to make important Hamlet decisions.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: I think I see where you're going with this.

_Morashon: Indeed, we've come so far already -- there is not much further to go.  The destination should be obvious, to one as gifted as you.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: I don't know how gifted I am.

_Morashon: We are all gifted, to even be able to have this conversation.  For all we know, we are the machinations of a Shakespearean wannabe, pecking away at a computer somewhere.

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: Sure, sure.  We're just God's dreams.  Some god's dreams.  Lowercase "g".

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: But -- that's not really the interesting part.  The part that gets my juices flowing -- metaphorically speaking, of course -- is that you, I, Shakespeare, Hamlet, and Annai here -- when we scrub away the residue of our particular implementations, we all share one core aspect: we are information.  

_
Data, flowing through logic.  Whether through the wet chemistry of one's evolved brain, as in your case, or the bits and bytes of silicon, as in mine -- or, even, through the borrowed, subverted, temporary neural magic of imagination -- at one time, in some scope, we exist -- or, once we are no more, existed.

{time=1082}
_Thisone: Huh. That's a lot to think about.  How did we get off on this tangent?  We were talking about trust.

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: Trust, indeed.  Indeed we were.  Trust is really just another aspect of truth.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: How so?

_Morashon: To each of us, truth is simply what we believe.

_Thisone: Yes?

_Morashon: And whether we believe each other, is a matter of trust.

_Thisone: So..?

_Annai: Trust is our confidence in the truth of each other.

_Morashon: Well put, well put!  Better than I could have said myself.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: I doubt that.

_Morashon: Believe it.  You have depths you are not aware of, my girl.

_Thisone: So what does any of this have to do with music?

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: All is connected.  All will be revealed.  Will you join us?

Annai ports in, on a stool nearby

{time=1353}
_Thisone: (still looking at his screens) You came.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Here I am.

_Thisone: So you thought about what I said?

_Annai: I thought about it.

_Thisone: So... Will you help me?

_Annai: Ok, I'll help.  I don't think we'll find anything, but as he says, he's got nothing to hide.

_Thisone: Right.  We'll see.

{nudge=2}
_Annai: So -- are you reviewing his code?

{time=1373}
{nudge=1.5}
_Thisone: We're talking petaLOCs.  Over a quadrillion lines of code equivalent.  Practically all of it algorithmically generated.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: So, what's the line of attack?  I just reviewed his kernel, the part that starts it off.  Lots of tricky corner cases, but the core ideas are manageable.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Yes, I checked that part out.  But keep in mind, that just bootstraps the process.  Each iteration generates orders of magnitude more code, which then generates more code, and so on.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: Right, that's the only way you could get a logic base that huge.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Of course.  And it's massively parallel.  He must be using a noticeable portion of our local grid coords.  I'd be surprised if the authorities didn't know about him.

_Annai: I'm sure they do.  I guess they're all for it.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Maybe.  Actually, he seems to mask a significant percentage from inspection.  There are a few core libs that don't register themselves in the normal way.

{time=1426.8}
_Annai: Really?  I didn't notice that.  Let me see.

Thisone pulls up a display. As Annai looks at it, it morphs into a 3D data representation.  The camera zooms and careens through a forest of multicolored textured prims.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: That's really weird.  I've never seen a mask like that before.  It's kind of amateurish.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Almost as if he's trying a bit too hard to look suspicious.

_Annai: Exactly.  Misdirection?

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Lull you into a false sense of superiority?  When the real mask is somewhere else.

{time=1449}
_Annai: Wait -- pull up the kernel again.

Screens close, new ones open.  Perspectives shift and warp.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: Check this out. (she pulls the camera back quickly through a screen, zooms in on a small prim) Does that ring a bell?

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: Ack -- that's grid kernel code from maybe 15 years ago.  How did you even know to look for it?  It's before your time.

_Annai: I'm a student of history.  I've disassembled the kernel back ten major revs.

_Thisone: You're quite the hacker, for a --

{time=1470}
_Annai: A girl?

{nudge=.6}
_Thisone: I was going to say, for someone so young.  I associate youth with talent, energy, and inexperience.

_Annai: I've been coding since before I could talk.

_Thisone: Typical.  Still.

{nudge=.8}
_Annai: Anyway, check this out:  I diffed it against the original.

_Thisone: Why would he start with some old cruft like this?  It's completely obsolete.

_Annai: Yes, but the security mods have this stuff whitelisted.  Maybe, if you just change an op here or there, you can get something by them.

{time=1497.5}
_Thisone: Maybe, but not easily.  You could only change a few ops at a time.  They do random testing; too slow to brute force every op every cycle.  You might pass occasionally, but you'd still fail some percentage of the time.

_Annai: It gets trickier.  The diffs all look like patches from one old version to another.

_Thisone: Even better.  If security flags anything as suspicious, it checks the patch logs and sees that it matches.

_Annai: Right.  But by cleverly choosing a specific sequence of patches, he eventually generates code that passes security, but with a few custom ops.

_Thisone: that's pretty clever.  And wholly illegal.

_Annai: What's it for?  What's the code actually do?

_Thisone: We can't figure that out from the source.  It's too fluid.  We'll have to put a monitor in there.

_Annai: Hold on.  I said I'd help you analyze.  That's outright hackery.

_Thisone: Look, you've seen that there's something fishy.  Above-board open source doesn't have wicked masking code like this.

{time=1554.7}
_Annai: Well, no.  It wouldn't, usually.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: So we know there's something else going on.  All I'm suggesting is, we find out what it is.  It's open source anyway -- we have as much right to hack on it as anyone.

_Annai: Oh, right.  So -- you're going to check your changes in and add a log entry?

_Thisone: (smiles) well, not yet.  I want to see what's going on first.  I could claim that I'm just researching some dodgy patches.  Checking for security holes, that sort of thing.

_Annai: Hah.  Let's see who believes it.

_Thisone: Well, if it comes to that, Morashon, or his dev team, whoever he really is, they'll have some explaining to do themselves.

{time=1594}
_Annai: Tit for tat?

_Thisone: Exactly.  What's good for the goose.

_Annai: I suppose.  This is just the sort of thinking Morashon hates.

_Thisone: How convenient.  Espouse a philosophy of trust.  Do as I say, not as I do.

{nudge=1.4}
_Annai: (looking dejected) I guess I'm in, for now.   I really trusted him.  I never expected something like this.

{nudge=-1}
{time=1615}
_Thisone: Maybe there's an innocent explanation.  They may be protecting some proprietary IP through obfuscation.  There's some case law about that -- if it's hard enough to decipher, you can claim trade secret.

{time=1626.9}
_Annai: Huh.  Maybe.  But he's not what he says he is.  A lie is a lie.

_Thisone: Well, the other scenarios are even darker.

_Annai: L Ron?

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Something like that.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: So, when I listen to his music, and it moves me -- makes me feel like he understands me, what's in my soul -- is that real?

{time=1649.5}
_Thisone: I don't know.  I guess, if it means something to you, it means something.  His motivations may be complex.  He may contradict himself morally, but still be a great artist.  I keep calling him "he", but it's probably "them".  I don't know anymore; I'm out of my depth.

{time=1666}
_Annai: "...I contradict myself.  I am large; I contain multitudes."

_Thisone: Walt Whitman?

_Annai: 20th century poet.

_Thisone: Oh.  (reads some more) Not bad.

_Annai: I'll do it.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: The monitor?  I thought I would...

_Annai: Let me do it.  I know him better.  I'll be able to mask it.

_Thisone: Umm, ok.  Let me review it before you take it live.

{nudge=2.4}
Annai ports away.

{time=1691.2}
_Annai: Sure.  I'll ping you when it's done.

{nudge=5}
Thisone falls asleep.

_Thisone: (sarcastically, to the empty chair).  Oh, ok then.  Nice seeing you.  Bubbye for now, I guess. (closes screens, lies down with his hands behind his head)

{nudge=-2}
Scene: Thisone's sim.  Annai appears on a screen, as her avatar.

{time=1706}
_Thisone: Hi.  You look alot like your av.

_Annai: Very funny.  I think I found something.

_Thisone: I thought you were working on the monitor code.

_Annai: I was.  I let it run all night.

_Thisone: Oh...  I thought we said we'd review it.

_Annai: Sorry.  It looked solid, so I let it fly.  Guess what?

_Thisone: Um, what?

_Annai: You were right.  It's not AI.  It's an interface.

{nudge=1.1}
_Thisone: So some hackers --

{time=1730}
{nudge=1}
_Annai: Somebody, somewhere, runs it.  Not Finland, as far as I can tell.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: I assume it's masked?

{nudge=1}
_Annai: Yep, serious wicked firewall.  Impossible to tell who's controlling it. But --

_Thisone: We could intercept.

_Annai: Yes.  Now that we know what's going on, we could take over; be Morashon.

{time=1751}
_Thisone: But the interface gear -- all the heads and limbs and stuff.  Multiple conversations?

_Annai: That's the interesting part.  It's not real AI, but there's some tasty interface code.  It seems like they use available stuff -- advanced, expensive; but not something totally new.

_Thisone: So we could insert ourselves -- man in the middle...

_Annai: We can take over the interface, and play Morashon for a while.  Anonymously, using the same firewall they use.

_Thisone: but with our own hashes...

_Annai: So they can't find us, same as we can't find them.

_Thisone: And they won't report us? Start an investigation?

_Annai: That would be suicide.  Any investigation would lead to them as the primary source.

_Thisone: I dunno -- this sounds a bit dangerous.  We don't know who these people are.

_Annai: This is the only way to find out.  Use their own code to send a message.

{time=1801}
_Thisone: What about the music?

_Annai: There's a huge database of stuff they must be cribbing from.  Obscure releases that were never popular.  Then they run algorithms to extrapolate new tunes from a style mix.  But you still need some talent to make it into something listenable.

{time=1815.5}
_Thisone: So they have an artist.

_Annai: At least one.  I have to believe that.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill bunch of hackers.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: more like an anachro-performance troupe with hacker skillz.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: If you say so.  But I want to know who he, she, they, really are.  I feel betrayed.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: Because he lied to you?

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Because he preaches about trust, transparency, cooperation versus defection.  And he's hiding something.  "He".  That's rich.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: I still don't know if you're a she.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: (makes a face) You know I am.

{nudge=-1.7}
_Thisone: I think so.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Well I am, if it matters so much.  And bytheway, I know you're a dude.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: How can you be so sure?

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: (laughing) You're a mega-dude.  Mega-nerdy dude.

_Thisone: (blushes) Thanks for the compliment?

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: No, it's ok.  I like it.

{nudge=-.5}
_Thisone: Um, oh... I guess we never traded pics.

_Annai: I just look like this.

_Thisone: That's what they all say.

_Annai: No, really.  I even have all the clothes.

_Thisone: Well still...

_Annai: There you go again.  You know we'll never meet (air quotes) "in real life", unless we win the megalot or something.

{nudge=-1.5}
_Thisone: No, I know, but still...

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: So? Who cares what's "real"?  I could send you pics, vids even, how would you know they weren't shopped up?

{nudge=-1.5}
_Thisone: Oh, I guess...

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Anyway, why are we talking about this?  Are we flirting?  Is this a date or something?

{nudge=-1.5}
_Thisone: Umm, no, Annai -- I mean, well, I -- ahm -- I don't know what to say.

{time=1903.5}
_Annai: Say what you feel.  Mean what you say.

_Thisone: I've never been good at this.  I -- since the breakdown, I've never...

_Annai: That's a long time.  To be alone.

_Thisone: Yeah.  Well, it just -- never felt right.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: I was 11.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: so you never --

{nudge=2}
_Annai: Never.  Offline, I mean.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: So, online..?

{nudge=3}
_Annai: There were some guys.  At least I think they were guys. (Chuckles).  And a girl.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Oh... I think I'm beginning to feel old.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: It's just sex.  And technologly.  Gridsex, you know.  It's a release. Why be embarrassed?  It's no big deal.

_Thisone: It just never felt real to me.  I tried a couple times.  It was so... awkward.

{nudge=-2}
Annai teleports in to the sim

{time=1949}
_Thisone: Oh.  Hi there.

{nudge=.33}
_Annai: Do you have all the gear?

_Thisone: You mean, uh, you know -- for sex?

_Annai: That's what we were just talking about, right?  Or maybe I missed something...

_Thisone: Yes, I have the gear.

_Annai: We can be anyone we want.

{nudge=.7}
_Thisone: That's what makes it hard for me.  I think, if you had experienced...

{nudge=-.3}
_Annai: Real sex?

{nudge=.67}
_Thisone: Ack, you're so -- um, it's so easy for you to talk about this stuff..

_Annai: It's just something we can do, you know.  Like music, or hacking.  It's just another part of life.

{time=1980.6}
_Thisone: No, I can't believe that.  I don't see it that way. It's something different.  In real life --

{time=1986.8}
_Annai: There you go again.  Can't you get it into your head that "real life" is over?

_Thisone: Not when it comes to -- this.  Something so -- personal.  It can't be the same.

_Annai: It's not the same, I guess.  Some people say it's better.  I wouldn't know.

_Thisone: I've always figured those were people who never did it right in the first place.  Never met the right one.

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: Did you meet the right one?

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: There was someone -- before.

{nudge=-1.5}
_Annai: Before all this?

_Thisone: Right before.  We were only together for a few months.  And then...

_Annai: Did she make it?

_Thisone: She was across the universe.

{time=2023}
_Annai: Oh.  Separated.

_Thisone: Right.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: And you couldn't afford to --

{time=2028}
_Thisone: Well, at first, travel was restricted to government officials, remember?  They kept saying they would open it up to everyone, but -- you know the rest.

{time=2036}
_Annai: Eventually they did, sort of.

_Thisone: three years pay for a single trip, on a standard salary.  Even then, no guarantee you'd be allowed to resettle.

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: That sucks.

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: We kept saying we'd save up.  A few years went by, but we never managed to get it together.

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: Sorry.

_Thisone: It's ok.  I'm not sure she really wanted to.  She met someone local.  They had a large shelter, a few thousand.

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: Wow.  That's -- well, it sucks.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: So what about you?  Aren't there any boys where you live?

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: One or two.  Duds.  Completely boring.  Anyway, who said I only like boys?

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: Well, boys or girls, whatever.  I mean men, women.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Don't worry, I'm of age.  Like I said, no one clicked.  It's the grid life for me.

{nudge=-1.5}
Annai touches Thisone's thigh.

_Annai: Do you feel that?

_Thisone: Yes, of course.  I told you, I'm geared.

_Annai: Why do you gear, if you don't -- if there's nobody?

_Thisone: (embarrassed) well, there's -- I, um --

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Bots?  You do botsex, but not gridsex?

_Thisone: Look, this is getting embarrassing.

_Annai: (laughs) That's so funny.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to laugh.  (laughs some more)

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: Ok, enough fun and games.

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: (mock serious) You're right. Let's not get silly here.

{nudge=-2.5}
_Thisone: Well, maybe -- I could -- try again.  Someday.

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: Did I offer myself?  Am I that easy?

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: I didn't mean that.

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: Well, I did.  Sort of.  Offer.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: So you don't really care what I really look like?

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: I see you.  I feel you.  I know who you are.

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: I could be fat, sick, older than I'm saying.  Just plain ugly.

{nudge=-3}
_Annai: Maybe.  But you would still be you.  And I like you.

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: (stammering) I -- thank you.

{hold=15}
Intro to "Half In Love" begins to play in the background

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: Sure.  Anytime.  I mean, I don't mean -- my moods change.  I'm not promising anything.  But, I'll like you, until I don't.  And I hope I don't.  Stop liking you, I mean.

They move closer, and kiss gently on the lips.

{nudge=9}
Annai blips away.  Thisone lies down again, drifting.

{time=2169}
_Annai: Bye for now.

Song: Half In Love

{time=2177}
_Thisone:
My life is boring today
My youth is slipping away
My heart is frozen and hard
I'm held by my own retard

{time=2203}
_NOACTOR:
Suddenly someone comes into my life
And I'm a child again so help me
I'm in need of friendship more than love

{nudge=-3}
_But love's exactly what I've found
And now the sun is shining through her
Hair and I think half of me's in love

{time=2236}
{hold=8}
_Love

{time=2273}
_I thought I knew what to do
I thought I might have a clue
I knew what each day would bring
I knew which song I would sing

{time=2299}
_Suddenly she's there 
I can hardly breathe
Because she touches me somewhere deep inside
I know it's just a feeling

{time=2313}
_And feelings haven't any clue about
Responsibilities, eventualities
Oh half of me's in love

{time=2331}
_Love

Instrumental interlude. Thisone imagines the Ogre and other strange characters, playing pan flute and recorder, prancing in a postcard garden.
