Scene: private booth at a fancy restaurant.  Annai is already sitting in the booth; Thisone ports in. 

_Annai: Hey stranger.  Come here often?

_Thisone: Hi. 

{nudge=2.5}
(After a little hesitation, he pecks her on the cheek)

{nudge=1.5}
_Annai: Why here?  Your place has been fun lately.

_Thisone: I don't know.  I want to talk about stuff.  Paranoid I guess.

{time=12}
_Annai: Oh.  That's why you ordered a private booth.

_Thisone: I thought someone might have bugged my sim.  Compromised my server.  A place like this, picked at random, is harder to jack without leaving a trail.  Lately I feel like I'm being watched.

{nudge=3}
(she puts a hand on his thigh)

_Annai: You probably are.  Nothing's private anymore.  I'm sure someone is getting off spying on us during our most intimate, private moments. 

{time=34}
_Thisone: (shudders) Ugh!  that's -- the idea makes me nauseous.  I've really beefed up my firewall, but I just don't know.  I thought we should take precautions.

{nudge=-.7}
_Annai: This is exciting! Like a spy vid!

_Thisone: I'm serious.  We don't know who we're dealing with.  Did you order the equipment?

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Yep.

_Thisone: Everything?

_Annai: I told you I would.

{time=55}
_Thisone: That must have cost a fortune.

_Annai: Put it on my school cred.  I've got three years left.

_Thisone: Oh -- I don't want to jeopardize your education with all this.

_Annai: Don't worry.  I wasn't planning on going back.

_Thisone: Well like we said, when this is all over, we'll sell the equipment and get your money back.

_Annai: Sure.  Unless we like it.  We could design a Morashon competitor.  Make a mint.

_Thisone: Start our own cult?

_Annai: Why not?  He did it.  How hard can it be?

_Thisone: So how is this going to work?

_Annai: We'll be getting the stuff in a couple weeks.  I need your real address.

{nudge=1.2}
Thisone messages Annai his address

{time=91.5}
_Thisone: Sure. Now you know where I live.

_Annai: don't worry, I won't stalk you.  That would cost real money.

_Thisone: I wouldn't mind.

_Annai: let's keep it "real".

_Thisone: you mean fake?

_Annai: Works for me.  Seemed to work for you last night.

_Thisone: (embarrassed) Sure -- it's been great.  Better than I expected.

_Annai: the gear gets better every year.

_Thisone: It's not the gear.

_Annai: (a little flustered) remember, it's just sex.  Gridsex.

_Thisone: I know.  But don't you feel -- something?  A little more than just --

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Let's keep it caz.

{time=124}
_Thisone: Right.  Special friends.

_Annai:  Exactly.  You're learning.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: I'm trying.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: you're OK, for an old dude.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: So. When the equipment comes...

{nudge=1.5}
_Annai: We intercept at the end of one of his concerts.

_Thisone: What do we do?  What do we say to everyone?

_Annai: Do what he would do.  We sing.

_Thisone: A song?  One of his?  He almost never repeats material.

{time=150}
_Annai: I'm working on it.

_Thisone: You play?

{nudge=1}
_Annai: I mix.  Same thing really.  The voices are all synthesized.  The only thing we need is lyrics.

{time=159}
{nudge=.5}
_Thisone: I could try and come up with something.

_Annai: It won't sound exactly like him.  The fans might know something's up.

_Thisone: Isn't that the point?

_Annai: Not really.  I think we just want to send him -- them -- a message.

_Thisone: So maybe he had a bad night.  It happens.

_Annai: Sure.  Not all his stuff is perfect.  And the sound is always changing.  We'll fake it and see what happens.

{time=183}
_Thisone: Then, after...

{nudge=1.3}
_Annai: We disconnect, let him take over again -- after the show.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: He's going to be mad as hell.

{nudge=2}
_Annai: He won't say anything in front of the crowd.  He won't know exactly what happened -- just that he was locked out of his own avatar for a few minutes.

_Thisone: It should be interesting to see his reaction.

{time=202.5}
_Annai: I can't wait.

{nudge=.5}
_Thisone: He'll be disoriented for a bit.  Someone might notice.

_Annai: He'll recover.  He's good.

_Thisone: Do we go backstage, like nothing happened?

_Annai: Have to.  Otherwise, he might suspect us.

_Thisone: Do you think he'll say something?

{time=219}
_Annai: Not to you.  He might talk to me privately.  I think he trusts me.  As much as he trusts anyone.

_Thisone: I guess you've betrayed him.

_Annai: No.  He betrayed me.  Took advantage of my naivete.  My youthful inexperience.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Could have happened to anyone.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: I guess age and experience count for something.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: You gain wisdom, and lose your innocence.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: I guess that's what's happening to me.  One quantum of innocence, traded for a quantum of experience.  People are shit; don't trust anyone.

{time=250}
_Thisone: He's not even a person.

_Annai: That's the part that has me stumped.  As much as I know now, I still think of him as if he's some sort of individual -- particular, unique.

_Thisone: Well, whoever put this together obviously has a strong personality.  The ego of the artist always shows through.

_Annai: So Morashon is a work of art?

_Thisone: Transgressive art, yes.  He's got me thinking, that's for sure.

_Annai: Yeah, he has me thinking too. I think I want revenge.

_Thisone: Revenge is not a very healthy emotion.

_Annai: We evolved it for a reason.

_Thisone: Deterrence?

{nudge=1.2}
_Annai:  Fighting the moral hazard.  If someone takes something from you and destroys it, responding in kind gets you nothing back.

{nudge=-1.2}
_Thisone: But --

_Annai: It's altruistic -- you're helping the next potential victim.

_Thisone: By teaching the defector a lesson?

{time=300}
_Annai: Tit for tat.

_Thisone: Prisoner's dilemma, in a community setting.

_Annai: I guess we read the same stuff.

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: So, Annai...

_Annai: Yes?

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Well, um, I was wondering...

{nudge=1.5}
_Annai: What am I doing tonight?

{nudge=1.5}
_Thisone: We could hang out at my place, later.  After we talk.

{nudge=1.5}
_Annai: Sure.  Nothing cooking at my end.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: Have you seen him?

{nudge=2}
_Annai: Since we found out?  No.  I've stayed away.

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: You should probably show up once or twice.  Stick to your routine.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: I don't know if I can face him.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Just be yourself.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: I'm afraid he'll know something's wrong.

_Thisone: You're a big girl.  You can handle it.  Make up an excuse.

_Annai: That time of the month?

_Thisone: Whatever.  You know him.  Whoever he is, they are, they can't read your mind.

{time=348}
_Annai: Ok.  But I want you to come.

_Thisone: No, that's not a good idea.

_Annai: Why not?

{nudge=.5}
_Thisone: Well, for one thing, he might figure out about us -- that we're, um ---

{nudge=.25}
_Annai: Fucking?

{nudge=.75}
_Thisone: In a word.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: So what? He's not my lover.  What's it to him?  As far as I'm supposed to believe, he's not even human.

{time=367.5}
_Thisone: I don't know.  I have a hunch.

{nudge=.5}
_Annai: You think he could be jealous?

{nudge=.5}
_Thisone: We still don't know who's behind this.  A jilted lover?

{nudge=.5}
_Annai: Trust me, if anyone I ever slept with had this kind of talent, I'd still be with them.  In any case, I would know.  It's not anyone from my life, real or grid.

{time=386}
_Thisone: How 'bout I piggyback?

_Annai: So you'll come with, as a ghost?

_Thisone: I'll see and feel what you do, and be able to talk to you.

_Annai: But no one else will know?

_Thisone: Right.  Just  you and me.

_Annai: From sea to shining sea.

_Thisone: Right.  Stuff sticks in your head.

{time=404}
_Annai: Like a virus.

_Thisone: I'm hungry.  Let's eat.

{time=407.75}
_Annai: Ok.

{nudge=-2.5}
Waiter brings out the food. They begin to "eat".

{time=412}
_Annai: This stuff is great.  My compliments to the chef.

_Thisone: One thing they haven't gotten right yet.

_Annai: Yeah.  I'm really eating a yeastburger.

_Thisone: Ugh.  I've got mac and cheese.

{nudge=4.4}
(waiter pours wine as scene fades)

{time=425}
_Annai: Well, it looks beautiful.  (cuts into virtual filet mignon)  Presentation is everything.

{nudge=-3}
scene: Morashon's salon.  He is alone.  He has a normal human form (one head, four limbs); Annai materializes.

{time=435.4}
{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: Annai!  How nice of you to come.  You look marvelous.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: (looking around) Where is everyone?

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: Oh, out and about.  More will come presently.

_Annai: You said you wanted to talk.

_Morashon: Where is that lovely boy you've been so attached to lately?  This one -- that one?

_Annai: He's working.  Might drop by later.

_Morashon: I'm afraid we've overwhelmed him with conundrums.  You're sleeping with him?

{time=461.5}
_Annai: Yes.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Well that's just beautiful.  You humans, with your sex!  What a divinely bizarre invention.  No God could have thought that up.  Atheists, here's your proof!

_Annai: We're not hitched or anything.  It's just a diversion.

_Morashon: For you, perhaps.  I've heard it can lead to stronger attachments.

_Annai: I can handle him.  I'm a big girl.

_Morashon: Yes, indeed, you are.  A big girl.  My grown up little girl.

_Annai: I'm not yours.

_Morashon: No, I suppose not.  Not anymore, anyway.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: What's that supposed to mean?

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Nothing, nothing really.  I've seen you change since we first met.

{time=502.5}
_Annai: That was less than a year ago.

_Morashon: We live in accelerated times.  What is a year, when we never see the sun?

{time=512.6}
{nudge=-.5}
_Morashon: Something has changed.

_Annai: What do you mean?

_Morashon: Your feelings towards me.  I sense a resistance.  Suspicion even.

{nudge=.5}
_Annai: It's not you.  I'm feeling scattered lately.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: Maybe this boy means more to you than you think.

_Annai: Why are we talking about this?  We usually talk about philosophy.  History, art, science, religion.  Music.  Not me!  You've never asked about my personal life before.

{nudge=1}
_Morashon: It's never interfered with our relationship before.

{nudge=.5}
_Annai: I don't know what you're going on about.

_Morashon: I feel him.  I feel his love for you, and his suspicions about me.  I feel them coursing through your veins.

_Annai: Well, you've got a lot of feelings, for a piece of code.

{time=556}
_Morashon: As I've explained before --

_Annai: I know, you have something like feelings, emotions.  You profess to have 'qualia'.  You've certainly passed the Turing test, as far as I'm concerned.

_Morashon: Feelings, intuitions, qualia -- they're all just the result of subtle patterns of information, flowing through our mental substrate.

_Annai: But why do I feel them, as if they're real?  Blue is so blue.  Sad is so fucking sad.  Hope is so pointlessly hopeful.  I feel it, feel it in my soul.  My consciousness can't be explained away as just a bit of code.

_Morashon: I feel similar things, in my own way.  These perceptions are emergent phenomena.  If the informational context is there, the qualia emerge.

_Annai: That's easy for you to say; you know you're bits of silicon, right?

{time=605.5}
_Morashon: (warily) Right...

_Annai: But I'm flesh and blood.  Thisone too.  When we touch --

{nudge=.5}
_Morashon: You've touched?  In real life?

_Annai: No, of course not.  I just meant --

{time=617}
_Morashon: Well then, all your interactions are digital -- just like ours.

_Annai: I realize that.  It's just --

{time=623}
_Morashon: For all you know, Thisone is another AI.  Perhaps he's the one I've been sensing.  I know there's another in the Grid, somewhere.  He could be feeling me out.  Doing it through you.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: Since when are you so paranoid?  You always preach "trust first".

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: Trust, but verify.  My philosophy is simple: give everyone the benefit of the doubt, at your first encounter.  Thereafter, judge them by their actions.

_Annai: So -- what has Thisone done to make you not trust him?

_Morashon: He is trying to steal your heart.

_Annai: From who?  What do you care if we have a relationship?  Why does this matter all of a sudden?  You didn't give a shit when Alexa was around.

{nudge=-.4}
_Morashon: Alexa never really mattered to you.  This one does.

_Annai: Stop making fun of his name.  Your name is meaningless.

{time=671}
_Morashon: Hardly.  It was not chosen at random.

{nudge=.4}
_Annai: Well, it doesn't search up as anything.  Maybe you got the spelling wrong.

{nudge=.6}
_Morashon: (laughs)

{nudge=1.4}
_Annai: And another thing -- why are you so normal-looking all of a sudden?

{nudge=-.7}
_Morashon: As you well know, I change my form to suit my mood.  And the situation.

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: I've just never seen you look this -- human, is all.

{nudge=-.5}
_Morashon  Shapes, forms, appearances.  It's all just fancy graphics.  Why does it matter to you?

{nudge=2}
_Annai: Visual representation is all we've got to go on here, in the Grid.  You know that.  That's why I never change my avatar.  I want to feel like I know who I am.

{time=710}
_Morashon: Maybe I don't want to feel that way.  We are different species, you and I; we inhabit different metrics.  Time works differently for me.  I am evolving before your eyes.  Perhaps I'm tired of being everyone and everything.

_Annai: Maybe your friends aren't at their controls today.

_Morashon: That sounds like your boyfriend talking.  Does he still believe I'm a performance troupe from Finland?

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: He doesn't know what to believe.

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: Do you?

_Annai: (looking into his eyes) I don't know.  I guess I have some doubts.

Intro to "Mr Happy"

{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: About who I am, or about the things I've taught you?

{nudge=-1}
_Annai: I can't really separate the two.  How can I know whether to believe what you say, if I don't know who you actually are?

{nudge=-1.6}
_Morashon: It may surprise you to hear, but I am capable of doubting myself.

{nudge=-1.6}
_Annai: At least you know who you are.  You have that advantage over me.

{time=762}
{nudge=-1}
_Morashon: Because you don't know who I am?  Or because you don't know yourself?

{nudge=-1.6}
_Annai: Look -- you know if you're really software, or a human being faking it.  I know I'm a human being.

{nudge=-4}
Morashon's face displays a slight smile

_Annai: What?  What are you trying say?  Is this one of your head fake zen lectures?

{time=780}
_Morashon: I'm just saying, software has feelings too.

Song: Mister Happy
Visual idea: Morashon is a mechanical automaton in some sort of arcade.  Either Chuck E. Cheese, or one of those old fortune-telling machines in a glass booth.  His face, plastic and doll-like, is painted in clown colors dulled by age.  His head and limbs move jerkily as he sings.

{time=786.5}
_Morashon:
When
Mister Happy comes
Life will be a dream
Everything will glisten

Nobody will be sad
Everyone will smile
Everybody listen to the sound

{time=1121}
_Annai: About time.

{nudge=1}
_Thisone: Sorry.  I've been pacing around like a madman, trying to figure things out.

_Annai: Still want to go through with it?

_Thisone: More than ever.  That fucker is insane.  I think he's in love with you.

_Annai: That makes him insane?

_Thisone: No, they're orthogonal statements.  You know what I mean.  If he's actually a he, why does he tell everyone he's an AI?  If he's really AI, how can he be in love with you?

{time=1146.3}
_Annai: I don't think he's in love with me.  That's ridiculous.

_Thisone: Why do you say that?

_Annai: What's to love?  I'm just another grid chick.

_Thisone: and I'm just another horny coder dude looking for gridsex.

_Annai: Right.  We're just stereotypes in someone's crappy vidflick.

_Thisone: So life has no meaning?

_Annai: I didn't say that.  Sometimes my life feels meaningless.  Other times not.  I thought Morashon meant something.  Apparently, he's just another crappy guy.

_Thisone: Trying to sell us Bogus Happy?

_Annai: He said it, not me.

_Thisone: Tomorrow night?  He's been tagged you know, the audience will be orders of magnitude bigger than ever.

_Thisone: I know, I know.  I'm still nervous, even if it is just glorified DJ-ing.  We'll have to react to anything unexpected.

_Annai: What?

{nudge=-1.1}
_Thisone: It's an old saying.  Means good luck.
