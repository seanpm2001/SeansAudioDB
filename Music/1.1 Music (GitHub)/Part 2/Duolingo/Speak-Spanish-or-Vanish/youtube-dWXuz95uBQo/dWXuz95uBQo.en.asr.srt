1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,744
Are you sitting down? We need to talk.

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,756
You made a promise

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,716
Rain, snow, or apocalypse

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,343
You wouldn't stop this

5
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,384
Streak we had going

6
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:13,351
No tengo respuesta

7
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,667
Nadie me contesta

8
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:17,033
Esto me molesta

9
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:19,095
I'm not joking

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,140
When I say I'm about to up the stakes

11
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:27,339
Si no practicas, ¡ya verás lo que sucede!

12
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:30,615
It's either Spanish or Vanish

13
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,594
No es una petición

14
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:35,095
No I demand it

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,316
Two choices Spanish or Vanish

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,381
Amo la carne humana

17
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:42,746
I'm muy famished

18
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,036
Spanish or Vanish

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,067
No tolero la estupidez

20
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,477
No I can't stand this

21
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:53,860
Pick one, it's Spanish or Vanish

22
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:55,698
Soy conocido por comer cabezas

23
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,344
Like a praying mantis!
