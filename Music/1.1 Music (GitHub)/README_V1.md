# README - For the GitHub Music directory

My music collection is eventually going to exceed 1000 sub-directories in the main root, and GitHub automatically truncates files and directories after 1000 items are put in the root of the directory.

This directory is GitHub exclusive. If you download and use this lite version of my audio collection, and you want to have all the necessary files in the root folder, you will just have to:

> * Download the repository

> * Navigate to the `/1.1 Music (GitHub/Part 1/` directory

> * Select all (CTRL + A | `⌘` COMMAND + A)

> * Either cut (CTRL + X | `⌘` COMMAND + X) or copy (CTRL + C | `⌘` COMMAND + C) the data

> * Navigate to the `/1 Music/` directory

> * Paste (CTRL + V | `⌘` COMMAND + V)

If there are multiple parts, repeat this process to them as well, and you will have the exact same layout as me (the only difference being I have thousands of files that I can't upload due to size and copyright reasons, so unfortunately you can't have those yet, unless you were to download them yourself)

Again, this was all done due to GitHub truncation at 1001 items
