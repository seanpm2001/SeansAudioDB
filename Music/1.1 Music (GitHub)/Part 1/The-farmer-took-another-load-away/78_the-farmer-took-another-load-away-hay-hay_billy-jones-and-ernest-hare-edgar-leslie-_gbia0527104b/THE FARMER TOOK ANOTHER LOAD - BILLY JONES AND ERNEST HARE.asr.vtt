00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's load up the old hay
truck and drive to town today.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
All the farmers,
all the farmers took another load away.

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:32.001
Hey, hey, farmer Gray took another load away.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.001
I got married and the law
passed but quite a few.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:52.000
Told your wife refused to let
her mother live with you.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.001
I have a dandeland Lord
now how he makes me laugh.

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.001
He walked in today he said
and cut my rent in half.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.001
All the farmers,
all the farmers took another load away.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.001
Hey, hey, farmer Gray took another load away.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.001
Robert broke into our
house but they left again.

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.001
Calls the clock at just a
five and they were union men.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I rode on a street car once holding on a scrap.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
When a girl said if you're
tired please sit on my lap.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I don't need a five to set standing in my home.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Your wife gives you Halifax
without a two bay toll.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.001
All the farmers,
all the farmers took another load away.

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.001
Hey, hey, farmer Gray took another load away.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.001
How do you do everybody?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.001
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, no, no, no, no.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'll tell them in the high voice.
This is Billy Jones and Ernest Hare.

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.000
Bill, Bill, Bill,
don't forget yourself will you?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Pull yourself together and stop wondering.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.001
Excuse me.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
All right, go ahead. Lay on Dave, lay on.

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:26.000
Mary had a little lamb but she still did dead.

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:30.000
Now she takes the lamb to school
between two hunks of bread.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Talk about your honest men. I am taking facts.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:37.001
You paid five years in
advance on your income tax.

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:41.001
Moonshine all around the town,
sunshine's all ahead.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.001
But it's just the sunshine folks
that makes his nose so red.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I just bought a suit of
clothes from Levi and Bloom.

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:53.000
And now you can't sit down because
there's only standing room.

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:57.000
All the farmers,
all the farmers took another load away.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.001
Hey, hey, farmer, great, another load away.

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.001
[...] the old days, all the old days.

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:16.000
All the old days, all the old days.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.001
One girl changes gowns each day,
twenty times I'm told.

00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:27.000
But that gal you talk about
is only three months old.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.001
I was scared to death last night when
a great big pup, he grabbed you by the

00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:35.000
throat and said, Give me your powder, pup.

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:39.000
Doctor Smith fell in a well
but he might have known.

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:42.001
Doctor should attend the sink
and leave the well alone.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.001
I think that we've sung
enough of this little song.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I do too,
let's sing the chorus and we'll run along.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
All the farmers,
all the farmers took another load away.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Hey, hey, farmer, great, another load away.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Hey, hey.
