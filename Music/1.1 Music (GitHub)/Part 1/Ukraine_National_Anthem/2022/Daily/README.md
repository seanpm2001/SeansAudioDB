# Playing the anthem of Ukraine every day until the Russo-Ukrainian war ends

I know I should have started this much earlier if I were to do it all, but I am doing it now.

To clarify: I am requiring myself to listen to a variation of the Ukraine anthem at least once per day. It isn't the only thing I listen to each day. The variety remains the same. I also expect that the end of this war may be years away, so this is a long term goal.

Even after the war ends, I will still listen to the anthem from time to time.
