# Python Class CS 1 Playlist

This playlist contains the songs that I heard other people playing while in my Python programming class in High School. It became a major distraction at times, and had to be stopped, but it gave the class some good positive energy. It was also rather nostalgic.

## Track list

- 1 : Hello World (unknown artist)
- 2 : Wii Theme (but it's September Remix) (unknown artist)
- 3 : Wii Theme (Murcy, turn it up Remix) (unknown artist)

I may rediscover more songs in the future.
