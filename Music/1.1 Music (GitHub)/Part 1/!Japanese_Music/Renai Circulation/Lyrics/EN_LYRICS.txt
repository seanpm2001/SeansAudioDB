Ren'ai Circulation
But that's not it, it's no more!
Your mind will evolve More more
If it is a relationship that will disappear if you put it into words
I thought I should do it if I deleted the words I was afraid
But is that something different?
From Senri no Michimo Ipo!
Hard like a stone With such a will
If there is dust, it will be a mountain and a devil?
I'm not going to die!
Fluffy Fluffy
You call the name It just floats to the air
Fluffy Fluffy
You are laughing it just makes you smile
Thank God
Even fate mischief
It is happy that I was able to see you
But that's not it, it's no more!
Your mind will evolve More more
That's right I'm not right I'm still not
Look at me, forever
As you in me
My presence in you is
I know it's not big yet
Now this same moment
Feeling shared
If there is dust, it will be a mountain!
Abbreviation?
Kurakura kurakura
If you look up at you, it's just too dazzled
Kurakura kurakura
I'm thinking of you
Thank God
Even fate mischief
It is happy that I was able to see you
