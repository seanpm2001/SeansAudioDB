> **Note** Double Clef FM has 2 variants: PC and PS2. They are both counted as the same station (so there are 9 stations, not 10)

I may miss some songs, please let me know if I missed any.

The following stations I know are incomplete:

- [ ] Doble Clef FM (all songs missing)
- [ ] Flashback 95.6 (all songs missing)
- [ ] Game FM (all songs missing)

**Fun todo:** Make a custom track player for this playlist, with the station logos, and a similar GUI to GTA III.
