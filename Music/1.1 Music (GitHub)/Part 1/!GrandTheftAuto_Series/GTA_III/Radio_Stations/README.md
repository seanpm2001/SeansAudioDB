# GTA III Radio Stations

_Part of the GTA III soundtrack._

<!-- [See a metadata list overview of the stations](MetaIndex.ls.txt) **Link may not work** !-->

**Completion progress:** `5` / `9` (`~55.55%` complete)

- [x] Chatterbox FM
- [ ] Double Clef FM
- [ ] Flashback 95.6
- [x] Game FM
- [x] Head Radio
- [ ] K-Jah
- [x] Lips 106
- [x] MSX FM
- [ ] Rise FM

> **Note** Double Clef FM has 2 variants: PC and PS2. They are both counted as the same station (so there are 9 stations, not 10)

**Missing songs**

I may miss some songs, please let me know if I missed any.

The following stations I know are incomplete:

- [ ] Double Clef FM (all songs missing)
- [ ] Flashback 95.6 (all songs missing)
- [ ] Game FM (some songs may be missing)
- [ ] K-Jah (all songs missing)
- [ ] Rise FM (all songs missing)

**Fun todo:** Make a custom track player for this playlist, with the station logos, and a similar GUI to GTA III.

**Notes:**

- I have reached the end of the easily accessible songs (from the source I had) on 2023 March 29th. I will have to look deeper to find the rest of the songs.
- I am not doing this task full time. There may be long periods of time with no progress.
