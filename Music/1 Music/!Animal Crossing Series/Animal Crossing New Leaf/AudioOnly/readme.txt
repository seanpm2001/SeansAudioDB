art to the local museum. (Description from MobyGames.)

About this rip
--------------

Raw WAV files originally posted on Final Fantasy Shrine <http://ffshrine.org/>
by robotortoise1, then converted to FLAC and tagged by dada78641 with help
from others.

Not all of the music is present, unfortunately. This soundtrack is based on
whatever could be ripped directly from the decrypted ROM data, so streamed
tracks (like KK's music) are not included. We hope to make a new release
someday that includes these. This is also why the museum music is so plain,
since each room has an extra piece of music overlaid on top of it which we
could not rip.

Some tracks were spliced together. For example, when you go to the commercial
area, there's a short intro followed by the main part that loops. This
and a number of other tracks were put in one file since they're always
heard in sequence anyway.

All tracks are FLAC L8 and tagged to the best of our ability. We know that
Kazumi Totaka, Manaka Kataoka, and Atsuko Asahi were the composers for the
game, but we don't know who composed which song, so they're all credited
for each track.

The second museum aquarium track appears to be unused. Only the first track
plays when you walk around in any of the aquarium rooms.

An MP3 version of this soundtrack exists.

If you have suggestions or fixes, mail them to dada78641 <dada@tomatoland.org>.
