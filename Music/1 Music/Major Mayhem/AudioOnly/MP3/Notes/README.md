# Major Mayhem audio info

I initially recorded the Major Mayhem soundtrack with an MP3 recorder. It was the only tool I had at the time, and I didn't go further to get a better setup going. Due to this, the recordings I got are low quality, as they were recorded through the microphone, rather than the application itself.

They still sound good, and I can't seem to find an existing copy of the soundtrack online (I even tried extracting the APK and seeing if the audio was there. It either isn't there, or it is encrypted, and cannot be easily accessed)

I plan to fix up the 9 recordings I have now, making them loop more clearly, and remove excess whitenoise. Here is the current outline:

```subrip-text
Audio trimming: Major Mayhem
Cut out everything but:

Title theme
0:05 -> 0:29

Briefing theme
0:04 -> 0:32

Tropics theme
0:06 -> 1:00

Boss theme (phase 1)
0:05 -> 0:34

Boss theme (phase 2)
0:04/0:09 -> 0:32

Boss theme (phase 3)
0:04 -> 0:32

Metropolis theme
0:05 -> 0:33

Desert theme
0:04 -> 0:42

Mummy boss theme
0:07 -> 1:23
```

I don't know if this counts as Lo-Fi music. The games soundtrack itself was already pretty low quality (stock action music) but isn't that bad.
