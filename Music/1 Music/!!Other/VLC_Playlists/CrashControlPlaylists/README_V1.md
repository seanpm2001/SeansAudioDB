# Crash Control Playlists

## Purpose

These playlists are created prematurely when my device comes close to crashing and needs backup before the device can be restarted. If a playlist is destroyed before it can be backed up, screenshots and mental memory are used to recreate the playlists.

These originally weren't made public, but I decided to add them for better transparency and because I can easily do this on Friday 2021 September 3rd.
