# Ultimate compilation playlist

**Goal:** make a playlist out of my entire music collection (every single file)

**Requirements:** either a very powerful computer and/or just a script to automate indexing it but never opening it in VLC

**Note:** It may require over 500 gigabytes of RAM to load the playlist, if at all

**Past attempts:** did moderately well with 4 gigabytes of RAM (even under Windows 10) but came nowhere near as close as I wanted, even for the much smaller collection at the time in 2018

**Expected playlist file size:** between 10 megabytes and 10 gigabytes
