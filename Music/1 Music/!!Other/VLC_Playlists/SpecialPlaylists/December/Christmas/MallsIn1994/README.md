# Mall December 1994 playlist

All I want for Christmas hundreds of times, as the mall owners don't know how to loop music. The song came out in 1994, and is known to be played **WAY** too often near and during December.

The song isn't too bad in my opinion, but it is overplayed, thus I am continuing the repetitive "this song is too repetitive" joke

I can't copy and paste items in VLC, so this was all done manually. Luckily, all I had to do was locate the song once, then press `CTRL` + `O` + `[ENTER]` 399 more times.

The playlist is 26 hours, 6 minutes, and 53 seconds in length. I would keep going, but I feel like this is good enough.

This file (the XML playlist file, not the markdown document you are currently reading) can easily be compressed to a much smaller size, due to the repetition.
