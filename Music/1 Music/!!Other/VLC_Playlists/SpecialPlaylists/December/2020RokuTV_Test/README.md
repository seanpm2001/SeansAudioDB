# Roku TV Test 2020

I recently got a new 32 inch Roku TV (TCL brand) for Christmas (2020) to use as a secondary monitor. This playlist was the playlist used to test it.

It is a mixture of videos and songs, I didn't have too many good test videos. It was mostly display for a bit before I got bored.
