## Copyright

I usually label the ownership rights to the creator and not the record company. The creator made it, they deserve the credit.

If the song is over 70 years old, I label it public domain.

It would be nice to have a copyleft option

## Album Art

Another feature request: remove album art

Tested on 2021 November 9th: You can put an animated GIF as the album cover art, but it won't be animated, it will be a still frame
