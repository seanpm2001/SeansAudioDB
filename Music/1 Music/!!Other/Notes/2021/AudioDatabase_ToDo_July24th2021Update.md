## Difficult future goals

These goals will require a long wait/the abolishment of copyright to do so. I have now noticed that only sports channels do this, luckily it is a channel type I don't watch as often (>0.1% compared to other categories)

"Usage and distribution of any of the material here is forbidden without written consent of NBC" (not exact wording, but it is stupid, and anti-competitive/monopolistic. There is no way that the mass majority of people who actually want to use it will even get written permission, as you would need to pay hundreds of millions to get the attention of NBC. Copyright is a cancer.

I have noted that this phrase alone is only said on sports channels, does anyone know of it appearing on other channels constantly?

Anyway, here is the content to list:

- [ ] Tokyo Olympics 2021 music
