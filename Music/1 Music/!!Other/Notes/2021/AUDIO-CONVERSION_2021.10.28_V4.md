### FLAC

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Redo all songs in FLAC when a stable method is available.

Current problems: Abnormal file size (larger than the video and audio combined), file is completely playable (but damaged) and stays at 00:00/00:00 with no fast forward or rewind functionality.

</details>

***

### Tips and other info

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Do not have the loop one option on while processing videos, unless you want to deal with constant overwrite errors at the end of the file, followed by very rapid [close] and ALT + F4 presses

**VLC Tip:** _When going to open multiple files a second time, the original opened files are still there normally. Press escape and reopen, and it will clear. Using the x button on the dialog and reopening does not work, you have to press the `esc` key_

**BE CAUTIOUS OF DISK SPACE USAGE!!!**

VLC currently doesn't let me export audio in formats other than MP3, FLAC, and OGG.

MP3 files get album art, others don't.

Albums should also be exported when possible if there is a format that hasn't been exported to yet.

Album art should be placed in the playlist folder, so you don't have to dig through directories to find the individual image each time (it is a long way from `/1 Music/` to `/downloads/`)

Songs may have some glitches if played directly after export. These go away.

This project was inspired by finding out how easy it is to change file metadata on VLC Media Player, along with adding custom, nostalgic album covers.

Make sure to restart after converting audio if the cache is too high.
