# Audio downloads 2023 April 18th

Some audio downloads today, as I had lots of extra time.

## Safety Dance On Crack

> **Note** I found this song a few days ago on Reddit via r/deepintoyoutube, a lot of people say the modern version sucks and that this version is way better, I have a feeling that even if it has a chance of being good, it won't be as good as this version.
