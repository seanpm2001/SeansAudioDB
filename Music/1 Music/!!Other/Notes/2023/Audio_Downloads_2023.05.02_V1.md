# Audio downloads 2023 May 2nd

I thought that this was a cool idea. I found out about it via a recommendation. I am now applying it to all Animal Crossing games, except for New Horizons, as no-one has done that yet. Additionally, I will need to find the winter, rain, and cheery versions of these tracks in this format.

A lot of the videos are fragmented, so this may take longer than the rest of the time today and extend past midnight.
