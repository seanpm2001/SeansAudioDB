# Audio downloads 2023, Wednesday, August 30th

I went further with yesterdays idea, and went to also get Boom Beach sound effects, then later Clash Royale and Hay Day soundtracks. I eventually discovered that the APK file is the way to go, and should have been done to begin with.

## Boom Beach Boom Cannon sound effects

## Clash Royale APK

I didn't use the APK here, I instead used this repository:

**Link:** I also learned about the SUPERCELL Fan Content Policy through this project, and 2 new repositories related to it are planned for Saturday.
