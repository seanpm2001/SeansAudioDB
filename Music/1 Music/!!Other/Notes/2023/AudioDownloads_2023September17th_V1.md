# Audio downloads 2023 Sunday September 17th

I have been meaning to look further into Ukrainian music lately. I went to write notes for the first set of songs on 2023, Sunday, September 17th, but found that I missed one. I am going back for it here.

## Лисенко. Арія Остапа з опери «Тарас Бульба»

_Translation:_ `Lysenko Ostap's aria from the opera "Taras Bulba"`
