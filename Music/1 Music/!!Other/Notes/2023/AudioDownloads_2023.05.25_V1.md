# Audio downloads 2023 Thursday May 25th

I did some audio downloads today, even though I am **still** sorting Nightcore music that I downloaded last week (with 76 files to go, I could have finished this part today, I just didn't have the time) there is still a phase 3, where I make a copy, then delete all files, replacing them with `IGNORE.md` (then I can upload them to the Git SeansAudioDB shell)

I noticed that the channel I downloaded Nightcore music from has uploaded recently. I will not go back for this until I am done with the current set. Today, I just downloaded Ukrainian audio samples
