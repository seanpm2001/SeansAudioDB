# Audio downloads 2023 April 4th

A massive loss happened for my family tonight, we lost our dog Guinea. This was the last song that was looping in my head during the incident, and my brain now associates it as a song associated with death or loss, now being the 4th song in this series. It is a good song, I hope I can still listen to it normally. Goodbye Guinea, you were a great dog. I will always remember you fondly.
