# Audio downloads 2023 Thursday July 27th

I heard this song in Little Bavaria (Leavenworth) today, and found that I have heard it in the past, but never archived it. It is much more recent than I thought as well, coming out within the past 17 months. The person at the coffee shop we visited was nice enough to look the song name up for us, I could have gotten it based on keywords alone, but this helped to verify. It is very close to what I was thinking of, but a mostly different song. I know of one song with very similar instrumentals and vocals, this was not it. It is still included per archival policy rules.
