# Audio downloads 2023 August 17th

I downloaded new music today, YT-DLP was repeatedly throwing 403 errors, and I eventually went to check for updates. It would have been nice to have done this when the errors first started, as this was the obvious and easy fix, it actually performs better than before now. None of the videos are fragmented, and the speeds are increased. It was 5 months out of date. Too bad Google can't just let people download from the site without putting such complex burdens on developers (which these limitations are **always** broken very quickly) there is so much wrong with the site, yet they keep focusing their effort on the one part that is entirely meaningless (for example, embedding YouTube on other websites, such as Khan Academy, allows you to just render it as a plain HTML video, with zero restriction, and right-click + save as works instantly (it does this on and off for me, doing this for about 2 weeks now))

## Successful attempts
