# Audio downloads 2023, Wednesday May 17th

I downloaded this entire Nightcore channel today to get music, and to also find additional songs I missed. The download took over 4 hours, and used a lot more RAM than expected (just during the download, it used over 20 gigabytes of RAM) so I had to restart afterwards. It is going to take me a while to sort all of this and add it to the collection.

**Channel link:** [https://www.youtube.com/@NightcoreStern/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@NightcoreStern/videos)

Video count at time of download: 860

I could have just downloaded the audio and finished much faster, but I decided to download a video and audio version separately.
