# Audio collection update November 1st 2020

New plan for maintaining the collection: a new release will be published with every day with a new playlist(s) or playlist file set. I have failed on this goal for a few days.

Recently (about a week ago) YouTube-dl got taken down with a DMCA claim. I was worried it would lose functionality. It hasn't lost functionality until today. Either there is an update available, or it can't download certain categories of videos (music with claims) now. I have gone back to a hybrid usage of VideoDownloadHelper (Firefox) and YouTube-DL (Konsole)
The issues started: November 1st 2020
