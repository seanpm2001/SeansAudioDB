I found a funny video last night (technically at around 2:00 am in the morning) regarding Batman. I decided to download it. Let the next earworm commence.

Context: I have been browsing Reddit again on and off. When it gets bad, I stop using it for a while, then come back to receive another scalpel to the brain cells. I am now trapped with Reddit. It is still better than Quora in several ways, but I am suffering from the effects of dark patterns and content addiction. I don't use the site on a daily basis anymore, just when there is nothing better to do.
