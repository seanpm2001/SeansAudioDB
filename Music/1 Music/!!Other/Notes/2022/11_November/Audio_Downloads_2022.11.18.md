Eh, why not? Might as well complete the Animal Crossing collection, except I currently can't find the soundtrack for Wild World or City Folk.

I needed to get New Horizons in my collection, so this was a win.

Update: Nevermind, I have the City Folk soundtrack in my collection, the only one I still can't find is Wild World.
