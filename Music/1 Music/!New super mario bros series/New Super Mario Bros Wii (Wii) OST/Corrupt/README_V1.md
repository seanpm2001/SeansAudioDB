# Corrupt files

I converted this soundtrack to MP3 and OGG on 2023 July 31st. It was a huge process that required lots of breaks, and very high CPU usage over 4 and a half hours. Unfortunately, out of the 96 files converted, one appears to be corrupted (`y2mate.com - star_new_super_mario_bros_wii_music_extended_CiO8VDZl444_1080p.mp4`) which caused the following files to not convert:

- `y2mate.com - star_new_super_mario_bros_wii_music_extended_CiO8VDZl444_1080p.mp3`
- `y2mate.com - star_new_super_mario_bros_wii_music_extended_CiO8VDZl444_1080p.ogg`

I went back to try and redo it, but I found the file was corrupt, and there was nothing I could do to fix it. I also didn't account for size, 4.2 gigabytes of audio was generated. I can now listen to this music without playing the video at the same time. I am considering getting a non-extended version of the soundtrack, and also a compilation version.
