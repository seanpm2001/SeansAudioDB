00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The message you are hearing is part of a nationwide, live code test

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,000
of Emergency Alert System capabilities.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This test message has been initiated-

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,000
-by national alert and warning authorities.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
In coordination with Emergency Alert System participants including

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,000
broadcasts, cable, satellite, and wire line participants in your area.

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,800
Had this been an actual emergency, the attention signal you'd just heard 

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
would have been followed by emergency information, news, or instructions.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,600
This is only a test.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,000
We now return you to regular programming.
