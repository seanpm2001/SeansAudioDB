since May  there have been taking a day and night  but Bahamut stands  last year  last year 70 000 people lived there in  Batman in this city and now only few  civilians stay every inch of that land  is sucked in blood roaring guns sound  every hour trenches in the donbass  changed hands several times a day  in Fierce combat and even hand fighting  but the Ukrainian donbass stands  Russians  Russians use everything everything they  have against bhagavat and other  our beautiful cities  the occupiers have a significant  advantage in artillery they have an  advantage in ammunition they have much  more missiles and planes  than we ever had as it's true but our  Defense Forces stand  [Applause]  [Music]  [Music]  and we  end and we all are proud of them  the Russians tactic is primitive they  burn down and destroy everything they  see  they send thugs to the front lines they  sent convicts to the war  they threw everything against us similar  to the other tyranny which is in the  Battle of the Bulge  through everything it had again the Free  World just like the brave American  soldiers which held their lines and  fought back Hitler's forces during the  Christmas of 1944 Brave Ukrainian  soldiers are doing the same to Putin's  forces this Christmas  Ukraine  Ukraine holds its lands and Will Never  Surrender  so so here is the front line The Tyranny  which has no lack of Cruelty against the  lives of free people and your support is  crucial not just to stand in such fight  but to get to the turning point to win  on the battlefield  we have artillery yes  thank you  we
