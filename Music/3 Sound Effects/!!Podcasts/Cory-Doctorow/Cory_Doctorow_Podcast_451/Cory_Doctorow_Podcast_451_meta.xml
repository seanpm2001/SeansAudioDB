This week on my podcast, I present the prologue and first chapter of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Lost Cause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, my forthcoming solarpunk novel of Green New Deal world threatened by seagoing anarcho-capitalist billionaire wreckers and their white nationalist militia shock-troops. The book comes out on November 14 from Tor/Macmillan (US/Canada) and Head of Zeus/Bloomsbury (UK/Australia/NZ/SA, etc). As with all my books, I've had to produce my own audio edition, because &lt;a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amazon refuses to carry my work in audio form&lt;/a&gt;. You can pre-order the DRM-free audio and ebook and the hardcover &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/the-lost-cause-a-novel-of-climate-and-hope" rel="nofollow"&gt;through my Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you like my work and have ever wanted to say thank you, this is the best way to do so. These kickstarters don't just pay my bills, they also provide the financial cushion that lets me produce all the free work I've done for decades, including this podcast. What's more, they help me show other authors and the publishing world that when writers have their readers' backs, readers will return the favor.
