  <description>&lt;p&gt;
This week's podcast is a generous excerpt - 2+ hours! - of the audiobook for &lt;a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Attack Surface&lt;/a&gt;, the third Little Brother book, which is &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/attack-surface-audiobook-for-the-third-little-brother-book" rel="nofollow"&gt;available for pre-order today&lt;/a&gt; on my very first Kickstarter. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Kickstarter is one of the most important moments in my professional career, an experiment to see if I can viably publish audiobooks without caving into Amazon's monopolistic requirement that all Audible books be sold with DRM that locks it to Amazon's corporate platform...forever. If you've ever wanted to thank me for this podcast or my other work, there has never been a better way than to order the audiobook (or ebook) (or both!). 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Attack Surface is a standalone novel, meaning you can enjoy it without reading Little Brother or its sequel, Homeland. Please give this extended preview a listen and, if you enjoy it, back the Kickstarter and (this is very important): TELL YOUR FRIENDS.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thank you, sincerely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
