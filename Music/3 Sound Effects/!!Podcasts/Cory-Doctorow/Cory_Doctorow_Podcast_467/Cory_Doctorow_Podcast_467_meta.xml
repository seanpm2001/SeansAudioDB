  <description>&lt;p&gt; 

Today for my podcast, I read &lt;a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/05/cory-doctorow-no-one-is-the-enshittifier-of-their-own-story/" rel="nofollow"&gt;No One Is the Enshittifier of Their Own Story &lt;/a&gt;, my latest &lt;em&gt;Locus Magazine&lt;/em&gt; column, about the microfoundations of enshittification:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Therein lies the tale. The same people, running the same companies, are all suddenly behaving very differently. They haven’t all suffered a change of heart, a reverse-enscroogening that caused them all to go to bed the kinds of good-natured slobs who made services we love and wake up cruel misers who clawed away all the value we created together.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Rather, these people – leaders of tech companies and the managers and product designers they command – have found themselves in an environ­ment where the constraints that kept them honest have melted away. Whereas before a manager who was tempted to enshittify their offerings had their hand stayed by the fear of some penalty, today, those penalties are greatly reduced or eliminated altogether.
