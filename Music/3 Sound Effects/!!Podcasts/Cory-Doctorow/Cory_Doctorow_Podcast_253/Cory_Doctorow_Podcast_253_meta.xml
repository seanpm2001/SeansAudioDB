  <description>In honour of the Great Firewall of Cameron -- the UK government's plan to force ISPs to turn on network-level spying and censorship of "adult" material -- I've read aloud "There's no way to stop children viewing porn in Starbucks" , a column I wrote for the Guardian the last time the UK government floating this idiotic proposal, explaining, comprehensively, why this is such a stupid, stupid idea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mastering by John Taylor Williams: wryneckstudio@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Taylor Williams is a audiovisual and multimedia producer based in Washington, DC and the co-host of the Living Proof Brew Cast. Hear him wax poetic over a pint or two of beer by visiting livingproofbrewcast.com . In his free time he makes "Beer Jewelry" and "Odd Musical Furniture." He often "meditates while reading cookbooks."Â  &lt;br /&gt;</description>
