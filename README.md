## About

See above and below

# SeansAudioDB2
The personal version of my audio collection database. Not intended for public use. See the other version (not yet available)

***

# Goal

The goal of my audio collection is to archive every song and sound effect I have ever heard. So far, I am doing incredibly well with the music part of it (I have at least 80% of it archived) but the sound effect part is pretty difficult.

***

# Where is the audio?

The audio is the biggest part of this database. The database index ties it all together and works with it. However, there are 2 major reasons why I can't upload the audio:

> 1. Copyright

> * I can't upload most of the music to GitHub due to copyright reasons. 

> 2. GitHub 100 Gigabyte repository limit

> * Even if copyright wasn't an issue, I would still exceed the 100 Gigabyte repository limit on GitHub, as the audio collection takes up over 205 gigabytes in total.

This is one of the most important things, but it can't be added. Maybe if the copyrighted materials go into the public domain soon, and GitHub increases repository size, I may upload it, but I still fear that we are reaching the limits of Moore's law.

***

# Directory structure

My audio collection has a simple directory structure, where the root is the folder labeled `audio` and then there are 4 directories inside that contain all the audio within subdirectories. The directories are labeled as:

> * `0 Overview`

> * `1 Music`

> * `2 Music (projectless)`

> * `3 Sound effects`

The projectless music folder is an older version, but it contains a lot of music without project and other files (such as .txt, .xsfp, .odt, etc.

***

# Database language

The database is written in 7 computer languages (CSS, HTML, JQUERY, JS, PHP, RUBY, and XML) and 4 human languages (Bulgarian (for random Cyrillic characters) English, Russian, Ukrainian) however, the majority of it is in English
