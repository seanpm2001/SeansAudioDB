## 2021 November 25th

I decided not to convert audio today, as I needed more time to catch up on other projects.

After a hard drive backup on 2021 November 22nd, I have noted that I need to look into memory usage, and this project might be a factor. I only cleared up 20 gigabytes of free space from the backup. This project may get paused further, as I should be able to clear up 30 or more gigabytes of space from backups. This project also takes a considerable amount of time (2-4+ hours) to do daily as well.

I miss doing audio conversion. I hope to get back to it eventually.
