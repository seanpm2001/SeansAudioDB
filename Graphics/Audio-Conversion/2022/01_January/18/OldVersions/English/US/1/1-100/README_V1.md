## 2022 January 18th

I decided not to convert audio today, as I needed more time to catch up on other projects.

After a hard drive backup on 2021 November 22nd, I have noted that I need to look into memory usage, and this project might be a factor. I only cleared up 20 gigabytes of free space from the backup. This project may get paused further, as I should be able to clear up 30 or more gigabytes of space from backups. This project also takes a considerable amount of time (2-4+ hours) to do daily as well.

I miss doing audio conversion. I hope to get back to it eventually. - 2021 November 25th

I am going to try to keep adding a new public entry each day to this file for every day I don't convert audio. - 2021 November 25th/26th

I have been thinking of what to work on when I get back to this project, there is a lot that still needs to be converted, and I have had to switch from audio only to video with audio, as I just recently ran low on songs again. - 2021 November 27th

I am back to normal again, but I have not resumed conversion. There is still so much to do, I just don't have the storage. - 2021 November 28th

I considered doing some conversion today, but decided not to. This has been your daily update. - 2021 November 29th

I still have not resumed audio conversion today. - 2021 NOvember 30th

I started playing the game TreeWorld again today, I have found that the games DOES have music. I am going to need to put further effort into researching how to do an audio only recording  with good sound. - 2021 December 1st

Still no progress on audio conversion or research on audio recording on Android. - 2021 December 2nd

I think I solved the storage problem. Last night, I didn't want to do a hard drive backup, so I thought to myself that there has to be something already backed up I can delete to free space. I was in luck. I found over 38 gigbabytes of APK files, I thought I cleared my APK collection months ago. Of course, I did leave 1 copy of the latest functional version in each folder.

However, with the storage issue resolved, there is still the time issue. I don't have the time to convert audio right now, as I am already putting a lot of time into other tasks, notably the FINF-DB project. So I did not get back to audio conversion yet today. - 2021 December 3rd

I did not get back to audio conversion today. - 2021 December 4th to 2021 December 27th (I can't keep adding daily entries, it is too forced)

With my new Raspberry Pi, I am wondering if the process of conversion can resume again, maybe even as an all-day all-night thing (since it is a secondary device) - 2021 December 28th

I am getting really tempted to resume audio conversion. - 2021 December 29th to 2021 December 30th

I did not get to audio conversion this month.- 2021 December 31st

I was really tempted to convert audio files today, but I just didn't have the time. - 2022 January 1st

I was really tempted to convert audio files again today, but I still just didn't have the time. - 2022 January 2nd
