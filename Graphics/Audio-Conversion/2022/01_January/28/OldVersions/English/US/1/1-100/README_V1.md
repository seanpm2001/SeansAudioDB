## 2022 January 28th

I decided not to convert audio today, as I needed more time to catch up on other projects.

After a hard drive backup on 2021 November 22nd, I have noted that I need to look into memory usage, and this project might be a factor. I only cleared up 20 gigabytes of free space from the backup. This project may get paused further, as I should be able to clear up 30 or more gigabytes of space from backups. This project also takes a considerable amount of time (2-4+ hours) to do daily as well.

I miss doing audio conversion. I hope to get back to it eventually. - 2021 November 25th

I am going to try to keep adding a new public entry each day to this file for every day I don't convert audio. - 2021 November 25th/26th

I have been thinking of what to work on when I get back to this project, there is a lot that still needs to be converted, and I have had to switch from audio only to video with audio, as I just recently ran low on songs again. - 2021 November 27th

I am back to normal again, but I have not resumed conversion. There is still so much to do, I just don't have the storage. - 2021 November 28th

I considered doing some conversion today, but decided not to. This has been your daily update. - 2021 November 29th

I still have not resumed audio conversion today. - 2021 NOvember 30th

I started playing the game TreeWorld again today, I have found that the games DOES have music. I am going to need to put further effort into researching how to do an audio only recording  with good sound. - 2021 December 1st

Still no progress on audio conversion or research on audio recording on Android. - 2021 December 2nd

I think I solved the storage problem. Last night, I didn't want to do a hard drive backup, so I thought to myself that there has to be something already backed up I can delete to free space. I was in luck. I found over 38 gigbabytes of APK files, I thought I cleared my APK collection months ago. Of course, I did leave 1 copy of the latest functional version in each folder.

However, with the storage issue resolved, there is still the time issue. I don't have the time to convert audio right now, as I am already putting a lot of time into other tasks, notably the FINF-DB project. So I did not get back to audio conversion yet today. - 2021 December 3rd

I did not get back to audio conversion today. - 2021 December 4th to 2021 December 27th (I can't keep adding daily entries, it is too forced)

With my new Raspberry Pi, I am wondering if the process of conversion can resume again, maybe even as an all-day all-night thing (since it is a secondary device) - 2021 December 28th

I am getting really tempted to resume audio conversion. - 2021 December 29th to 2021 December 30th

I did not get to audio conversion this month.- 2021 December 31st

I was really tempted to convert audio files today, but I just didn't have the time. - 2022 January 1st

I was really tempted to convert audio files again today, but I still just didn't have the time. - 2022 January 2nd

I didn't consider doing audio conversion today. - 2022 January 3rd to 2022 January 18th

Considerations are being done to use the Raspberry Pi to convert audio, the only problems are that I can't take good screenshots on the Raspberry Pi yet, and I don't want to wear the SD card down too quickly. Screenshots on the laptop aren't possible at the moment either, as the `ALT` + `PRINT SCREEN` shortcut is having difficulties. - 2022 January 19th

I didn't consider doing audio conversion today. - 2022 January 20th to 2022 January 27th

I used VLC on the Raspberry Pi to test conversion today, and it seemed very plausible.  I received good results using VLC Media Player. The only thing stopping me from resuming audio conversion is the inability to take a good screenshot that isn't 2 screens wide without having to individually crop each image, and the inability to take a screenshot of just the current window, and nothing else without having to individually crop each image. VLC Exporting from WebM to MP3 works fine. It exports at the same speed as my laptop, and the file appears to be functional, but partially recognizes the exported file as a plain text file (icon-wise) but a functional MP3 file other than that. I need to test it across devices first, and also to attempt other conversion types (such as MKV to MP3, WebM to OGG, MP4 to MP3, etc.) it also doesn't tax my CPU, or cache, unlike my other device. The screenshot factor is still throwing me off, but I am looking for workarounds and fixes. - 2022 January 28th
