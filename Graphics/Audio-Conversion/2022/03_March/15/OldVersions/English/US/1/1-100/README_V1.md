## Important notes

### Revisions to documentation process

I have decided to revise the screenshot process. Since I am already able to get all the required visual area, I am producing uncropped versions. Versions with just the window can be cropped in the future. The current problem is that there are 2 screens being captured, and I don't know how to turn it off, so uncropped versions are currently being made. I have done some fun things with the dual screen capturing, such as listing album art to the side, or doing recursion. These will be cut out in the future, but the originals will remain.

The Raspberry Pi version of VLC has an option to fingerprint, but I will likely not use it.

### Resuming conversion via Raspberry Pi OS

As such, I have done more audio conversion today, and added metadata. Due to the estimated size of all images in comparison to the main DB repository, I have branched off into yearly image repositories for this project, the first one is located [here (2022)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/). Todays entries can be found [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/January/2022.01.29/). - 2022 Saturday, January 29th
