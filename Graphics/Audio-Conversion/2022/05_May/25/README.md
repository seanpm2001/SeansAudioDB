<!-- 
After a hard drive backup on 2021 November 22nd, I have noted that I need to look into memory usage, and this project might be a factor. I only cleared up 20 gigabytes of free space from the backup. This project may get paused further, as I should be able to clear up 30 or more gigabytes of space from backups. This project also takes a considerable amount of time (2-4+ hours) to do daily as well.

## Daily status updates

<details><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

I miss doing audio conversion. I hope to get back to it eventually. - 2021 November 25th

I am going to try to keep adding a new public entry each day to this file for every day I don't convert audio. - 2021 November 25th/26th

I have been thinking of what to work on when I get back to this project, there is a lot that still needs to be converted, and I have had to switch from audio only to video with audio, as I just recently ran low on songs again. - 2021 November 27th

I am back to normal again, but I have not resumed conversion. There is still so much to do, I just don't have the storage. - 2021 November 28th

I considered doing some conversion today, but decided not to. This has been your daily update. - 2021 November 29th

I still have not resumed audio conversion today. - 2021 NOvember 30th

I started playing the game TreeWorld again today, I have found that the games DOES have music. I am going to need to put further effort into researching how to do an audio only recording  with good sound. - 2021 December 1st

Still no progress on audio conversion or research on audio recording on Android. - 2021 December 2nd

I think I solved the storage problem. Last night, I didn't want to do a hard drive backup, so I thought to myself that there has to be something already backed up I can delete to free space. I was in luck. I found over 38 gigbabytes of APK files, I thought I cleared my APK collection months ago. Of course, I did leave 1 copy of the latest functional version in each folder.

However, with the storage issue resolved, there is still the time issue. I don't have the time to convert audio right now, as I am already putting a lot of time into other tasks, notably the FINF-DB project. So I did not get back to audio conversion yet today. - 2021 December 3rd

I did not get back to audio conversion today. - 2021 December 4th to 2021 December 27th (I can't keep adding daily entries, it is too forced)

With my new Raspberry Pi, I am wondering if the process of conversion can resume again, maybe even as an all-day all-night thing (since it is a secondary device) - 2021 December 28th

I am getting really tempted to resume audio conversion. - 2021 December 29th to 2021 December 30th

I did not get to audio conversion this month.- 2021 December 31st

I was really tempted to convert audio files today, but I just didn't have the time. - 2022 January 1st

I was really tempted to convert audio files again today, but I still just didn't have the time. - 2022 January 2nd

I didn't consider doing audio conversion today. - 2022 January 3rd to 2022 January 18th

Considerations are being done to use the Raspberry Pi to convert audio, the only problems are that I can't take good screenshots on the Raspberry Pi yet, and I don't want to wear the SD card down too quickly. Screenshots on the laptop aren't possible at the moment either, as the `ALT` + `PRINT SCREEN` shortcut is having difficulties. - 2022 January 19th

I didn't consider doing audio conversion today. - 2022 January 20th to 2022 January 27th

I used VLC on the Raspberry Pi to test conversion today, and it seemed very plausible.  I received good results using VLC Media Player. The only thing stopping me from resuming audio conversion is the inability to take a good screenshot that isn't 2 screens wide without having to individually crop each image, and the inability to take a screenshot of just the current window, and nothing else without having to individually crop each image. VLC Exporting from WebM to MP3 works fine. It exports at the same speed as my laptop, and the file appears to be functional, but partially recognizes the exported file as a plain text file (icon-wise) but a functional MP3 file other than that. I need to test it across devices first, and also to attempt other conversion types (such as MKV to MP3, WebM to OGG, MP4 to MP3, etc.) it also doesn't tax my CPU, or cache, unlike my other device. The screenshot factor is still throwing me off, but I am looking for workarounds and fixes. - 2022 January 28th

I have decided to revise the screenshot process. Since I am already able to get all the required visual area, I am producing uncropped versions. Versions with just the window can be cropped in the future. The current problem is that there are 2 screens being captured, and I don't know how to turn it off, so uncropped versions are currently being made. I have done some fun things with the dual screen capturing, such as listing album art to the side, or doing recursion. These will be cut out in the future, but the originals will remain.

As such, I have done more audio conversion today, and added metadata. Due to the estimated size of all images in comparison to the main DB repository, I have branched off into yearly image repositories for this project, the first one is located [here (2022)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/). Todays entries can be found [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/January/2022.01.29/). - 2022 Saturday, January 29th

I resumed audio conversion again today, and added more metadata. The data for today is available [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/January/2022.01.30/). - 2022 Sunday January 30th

I took a break from audio conversion today. - 2022 Monday, January 31st

I took a break from audio conversion again today. - 2022 Tuesday, February 1st

I did some audio conversion today, but there was an error. Here is the context:

I turned the Wi-Fi connection off on my Raspberry Pi last night, as I wanted to work without Internet. I found out the next day that the Raspberry Pi has no internal clock, and just continued from the shutdown at around 10:00 pm last night. However, I didn't fix it until I noticed the issue at 3:00 pm PST, when the clock hit midnight, over 4 hours after I started audio metadata additions. All images that date to a time before 2022 February 2nd at 1:00 am cannot be trusted for their creation date for this days entry. All images dating to 2022 February 2nd at 3:08 pm or later can be trusted for this days entry.

That being said, the files are not damaged, they are just misdated. The data for today is available [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/January/2022.02.02/). - 2022 Wednesday, February 2nd

I did not resume audio conversion today. - 2022 Thursday, February 3rd to 2022 Friday, February 11th

I resumed audio conversion today, but didn't generate metadata, as I didn't have the time. - 2022 Saturday, February 12th

I created metadata for the converted Bejeweled Twist songs, but not the rest of the playlist from yesterday. I did not resume audio conversion today. Data for today can be found [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/February/2022.02.13/). - 2022 Sunday, February 13th

I did not resume audio conversion today. - 2022 Monday, February 14th to 2022 Friday, February 18th

I created metadata for the rest of the playlist from a couple weeks ago. I did not resume audio conversion today. Data for today can be found [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/February/2022.02.19/). - 2022 Saturday, February 19th

I did not so any audio conversion today. - 2022 Sunday February 20th to 2022 Wednesday February 23rd

I did not so any audio conversion today, but there is a high chance I will resume tomorrow. - 2022 Thursday, February 24th

I did audio conversion today, but I didn't parse the Metadata yet. - 2022 Friday, February 25th

I did not do audio conversion today, I just parsed the metadata. Data for today can be found [`[here]`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/February/2022.02.26/) - 2022 Saturday, February 26th

I did not do audio conversion or metadata parsing today, I focused on getting caught up on other projects. - 2022 Sunday, February 27th to 2022, Sunday, April 10th

I attempted to get back on my Raspberry Pi today with the chance of doing audio conversion, but something went wrong with the monitor, and also the Raspberry Pi failed to boot after 2 attempts. I don't know how to troubleshoot this right now, so I didn't go further. - 2022, Monday, April 11th

I did not attempt to get back on my Raspberry Pi today, or do audio conversion. - 2022, Tuesday, April 12th to 2022, Monday April 18th

I successfully got my Raspberry Pi to boot today after 3 attempts, but I do not plan to resume audio conversion today. - 2022, Tuesday, April 19th

My Raspberry Pi has been running for nearly 24 hours now, but I am still not ready to get back to audio conversion yet. - 2022, Wednesday, April 20th

I have started digging around, but I am not able to decide what to convert yet, and I ran out of time again tonight. - 2022, Thursday, April 21st

I got back into audio conversion today, and converted the AdVenture Capitalist soundtrack, and 2 Beatles songs into both MP3 and OGG format. I have not yet attributed them. [`The entries for today can be found here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/04_April/22/). - 2022, Friday, April 22nd

Audio was converted on 2022, Friday, April 22nd, but has not yet been attributed. [`The entries for 2022 April 22nd can be found here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/04_April/22/) - 2022, Saturday, April 23rd to 2022, Monday, April 25th

The audio from 2022 April 22nd has been attributed today (2022 April 26th) [`and can be found here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/04_April/22/)

The audio from 2022 April 26th has been partially attributed today (2022 April 27th) [`and can be found here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/04_April/26/) I only did a little over half of it today. I hope to finalize this batch tomorrow. - 2022, Wednesday, April 27th

The audio from 2022 April 26th has been fully attributed today (2022 April 28th) [`and can be found here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/04_April/26/) I did the other 49.x% of it today. I also failed, as I forgot to remove the `- No data` header from this file for a few prime days. There is a chance I may resume audio conversion again tomorrow. - 2022, Thursday, April 28th

More audio was converted today, but has not yet been fully attributed. The entries cannot be found online yet, as they have not been parsed and uploaded. - 2022, Friday, April 29th

</details>

Audio metadata parsing (from 2022 April 29th) is on hold, and I can't convert any more new audio until this finishes. There is no new data for this day. - 2022, Saturday, April 30th to 2022, Wednesday, May 25th

### Revisions to documentation process

I have decided to revise the screenshot process. Since I am already able to get all the required visual area, I am producing uncropped versions. Versions with just the window can be cropped in the future. The current problem is that there are 2 screens being captured, and I don't know how to turn it off, so uncropped versions are currently being made. I have done some fun things with the dual screen capturing, such as listing album art to the side, or doing recursion. These will be cut out in the future, but the originals will remain.

The Raspberry Pi version of VLC has an option to fingerprint, but I will likely not use it.

### Resuming conversion via Raspberry Pi OS

As such, I have done more audio conversion today, and added metadata. Due to the estimated size of all images in comparison to the main DB repository, I have branched off into yearly image repositories for this project, the first one is located [here (2022)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/). Todays entries can be found [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB_Images_2022/tree/SeansAudioDB_IMG2022/2022/January/2022.01.29/). - 2022 Saturday, January 29th
