- [x] Added support for a security policy

- [x] Added support for a RepoData archive

- [x] Added support for Git files (`.gitignore` `.gitattributes` `.editorconfig`)

- [x] Added support for special files (`AUTHORS` `CREDITS` `INSTALL` `COPYING`)

- [x] Significantly improved the documentation of the `README.md` file

- [x] Added support for issues and discussions, along with issue and discussion archival

- [x] Added support for the new Slim audio directory, a much smaller and more compact version set choice for the collection

- [x] Added support for graphics

- [x] Added several new songs that are public domain

- [x] Added the docs (documentation) directory

- [x] Added support for GitHub sponsors

# `Conversion update 6 - June 11th 2020`

## Version 0.0.6

### About

I spent the majority of my time (over 4 hours) on GitHub today working on the audio collection project. I have started making some changes to ensure finalization of the structure, and also added tons of new playlists. I found out on my own today that this file structure is actually useful, as it serves as a backup of the file system for the audio collection structure, as it is always changing.

Today, I did a number of things, including:

> * Removing `IGNORE.md` files for directories from yesterday and the days before, as they are no longer needed in directories that already have files. Directories that don't have any files other than the `IGNORE.md` file were ignored

> * Added in playlists for the `F` section in the `1 Music/` directory

> * Added in important folders, and series folders up to `F` for the `1 Music/` directory

> * Added in some subfolders for the `!!Other` directory inside the `1 Music/` directory

> * Added in playlists for the `F` section in the `2 Music (Projectless)/` directory

> * Added in playlists for the `F` section in the `3 Sound effects/` directory

I spent several hours and made hundreds of commits for this update today.

This update marks the full conversion of the main database files and their notes. I have censored certain information from the files (only my phone number) and I have made them ready for GitHub.

This update adds several dozen new files to the project, and now I can start casually working on it.

This project is intended for my personal use. You are free to use it, but it isn't designed for other purposes. I plan on making a separate version that is designed for public use, I have been planning it all of May 2020, and now with GitHub, I feel like I have the resources to actually do it.

# Sean's Audio Database

Conversion update 1
-----------

As part of my new plan to fully convert projects to GitHub for better management, I have began to add more repositories to GitHub manually.

For this project, I was able to import 54 versions of the database script today. I added over half of the total database scripts.

This program is far from complete, and is intended for personal use.
