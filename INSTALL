Installing SeansLifeArchive/Extras/Audio (SeansAudioDB)
---

SeansLifeArchive/Images/ModernSmurfsVillage currently doesn't require installation, it is just a collection of images, audio, and data. It is part of the Seanpm2001 Life Archive project, and for proper "installation" the repository should be placed under /SeansLifeArchive/<yourInstalledVersion>/Extras/Audio/

If you want to load the first project language file, you will need to have a compatible HTML5 framework installed (version 5 or higher)

Due to truncation issues on GitHub, I had to slightly modify the audio database to work here. To view the collection correctly, you will need to cut the data from /Music/1.1 GitHub/ and place it in /Audio/1 Music/

The audio database application should work with HTML5 in older versions, but one feature in newer versions requires JQuery 1.10. This feature isn't too important, but if you want it, your device has to support JQuery 1.10 (the source code should already be provided)

Due to link rot, some (or many) of the links provided may not work correctly.

Due to the directory structure, playlist files will require certain modifications and the ownership of the audio files in the exact provided structure to work correctly

For Windows users, INI files are included in many directories that were created pre-July 9th 2020. These INI files will provide a folder icon on Windows XP to Windows 10 that makes navigation a lot easier. I am working on a similar method for Linux, MacOS, and BSD.

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in PNG format. Make sure your computer can handle images of 1920x200000/2560x1440/2560x1080/1920x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle JPG files.

Audio and video files are in a diverse array of formats, including OGG, FLAC, MP3, MP4, WMV, WEBM, MKV, OGA, OGV, AIFF, ALAC, M4A, MP2, MID, and other formats. It is recommended to just use VLC for these. MID (MIDI) files may require another program to work, or a modification to VLC. See https://wiki.videolan.org/Midi/

> If you are under Windows and don't want to modify VLC, use Windows Media Player to open MID files (not pre-installed on European and Korean versions of Windows since Windows XP/2009, NOT POSREADY 2009, specifically N, and KN versions of Windows)

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, and JPG. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.
