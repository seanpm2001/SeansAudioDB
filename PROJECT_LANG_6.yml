# Start of script
# Project language file 6
# For: Seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/
# I decided to make YAML the 6th project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/) as on 2022 Wednesday, January 5th, I decided to make project languages out of all the languages used on this project. This project uses a lot of YAML for configuration and workflows, so it was included. It comes in 5th in terms of usage, although JavaScript came in 6th, and was listed under project language file 2
# This is a rare instance in which I am using YAML as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language, and I extended this to other languages, this time with YAML. I found this out when snooping around on [Apple/Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes) if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your `.gitattributes` file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but `.gitattributes`)
gitattributes: ".gitattributes"
line1: *.yml linguist-detectable=true
line2: *.yaml linguist-detectable=true
