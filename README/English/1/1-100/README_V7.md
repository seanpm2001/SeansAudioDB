Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, over 25 translations are out of date and are using Version 8 or Version 9 of this README file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 1st 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

## About

See above and below

# SeansAudioDB2
The personal version of my audio collection database. Not intended for public use. See the other version (not yet available)

***

# Goal

The goal of my audio collection is to archive every song and sound effect I have ever heard. So far, I am doing incredibly well with the music part of it (I have at least 80% of it archived) but the sound effect part is pretty difficult.

***

# Where is the audio?

The audio is the biggest part of this database. The database index ties it all together and works with it. However, there are 2 major reasons why I can't upload the audio:

> 1. Copyright

> * I can't upload most of the music to GitHub due to copyright reasons. 

> 2. GitHub 100 Gigabyte repository limit

> * Even if copyright wasn't an issue, I would still exceed the 100 Gigabyte repository limit on GitHub, as the audio collection takes up over 205 gigabytes in total.

This is one of the most important things, but it can't be added. Maybe if the copyrighted materials go into the public domain soon, and GitHub increases repository size, I may upload it, but I still fear that we are reaching the limits of Moore's law.

***

# Directory structure

My audio collection has a simple directory structure, where the root is the folder labeled `audio` and then there are 4 directories inside that contain all the audio within subdirectories. The directories are labeled as:

> * `0 Overview`

> * `1 Music`

> * `2 Music (projectless)`

> * `3 Sound effects`

The projectless music folder is an older version, but it contains a lot of music without project and other files (such as .txt, .xsfp, .odt, etc.

***

# Database language

The database is written in 7 computer languages (CSS, HTML, JQUERY, JS, PHP, RUBY, and XML) and 4 human languages (Bulgarian (for random Cyrillic characters) English, Russian, Ukrainian) however, the majority of it is in English

***

# Why I do not use music streaming services

I don't use YouTube/Spotify/Pandora/other music services for music listening for many reasons:

## I like to listen to music offline

With Internet-based sites with no long-term offline functionality, I can't listen to music offline, or on my own terms. I download the music beforehand. I pay for the songs I like most.

## Platform suppression

YouTube is run like a brutal dictatorship. Anything Google wants to do, they do. Lots of videos in my collection can go down at any day for no explainable reason, in fact, over a dozen of the songs in my collection have been completely wiped off of YouTube. Luckily I have copies of them from before they were taken down.

## Memory usage

Sites like YouTube are really clunky, and are very inefficient, VLC handles video and audio so much better than YouTube. I have noted that YouTube uses 70 MiB of RAM per tab, even if the video is less than 3 seconds long. VLC hardly uses any, and has much higher functionality.

## DRM

I do NOT support DRM, and I don't want to use services that use DRM to listen to music, as I lose control of the music when DRM is in play.

***

These are the reasons why I don't listen to music online.

***

## Golden pitch

I have been experimenting with music pitch levels for several years in VLC media player. Too high of a pitch makes music sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks, too low of a pitch makes it seem like weird slow motion.

In VLC, under `tools >> Effects and filters >> Advanced` I change the pitch of the music a lot (also something I can't do on streaming platforms) I can go from -12.0 semitones to 0 to +12.0 semitones. For me, adjusting the pitch can make music better, and can make 1 music video into several new songs.

For instrumental music, I have noted `+8.5 semitones` to be the golden pitch of music for myself, a pitch that works perfectly on all instrumental no commentary music.

I have not found a golden pitch yet for music that has commentary/people talking/lyrics.

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
