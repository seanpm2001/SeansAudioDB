# Goal

The goal of my audio collection is to archive every song and sound effect I have ever heard. So far, I am doing incredibly well with the music part of it (I have at least 80% of it archived) but the sound effect part is pretty difficult.

# Where is the audio?

The audio is the biggest part of this database. The database index ties it all together and works with it. However, there are 2 major reasons why I can't upload the audio:

> 1. Copyright

> * I can't upload most of the music to GitHub due to copyright reasons. 

> 2. GitHub 100 Gigabyte repository limit

> * Even if copyright wasn't an issue, I would still exceed the 100 Gigabyte repository limit on GitHub, as the audio collection takes up over 205 gigabytes in total.

This is one of the most important things, but it can't be added. Maybe if the copyrighted materials go into the public domain soon, and GitHub increases repository size, I may upload it, but I still fear that we are reaching the limits of Moore's law.
