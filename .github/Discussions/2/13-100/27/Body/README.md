# Version 0.1.3.14 - 2021 Sunday November 14th update

## V0.1.3.14

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. This release archives the progress from 2021 November 12th to 2021 November 14th. I had to skip audio conversion for a couple days, and I got back to it today. I also decided to add KDE 3 sounds today, as they are freely distributable, and it is one less playlist I have to upload later on.
