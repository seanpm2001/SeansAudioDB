# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

This project is still in its early stages, although the only functional part is essentially a web application, or a set of media files. It is written in HTML5, jQuery, and a tiny bit of CSS, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem (I chose jQuery for one feature I was trying out, but it still didn't work the way I wanted it to, but I kept it in anyways, I was trying to make a popup about page)

For general security vulnerabilities, use the `security` label and start your issue title with `[SECURITY]`. Remember to not publicly post critical/zero day vulnerabilities, see more on this below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via GitHub. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

</details>

# Dependencies

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Dependency problems aren't very bad. This project uses 5 different languages:

- [x] HTML5

- [x] CSS3

- [x] JQuery

- [x] JSON

- [x] Shell (BASH)

You can still report dependency problems, but dependencies usually won't be updated unless they get too old (5+ years before the most recent release) or they aren't common enough to download anymore. The current dependencies this project has include:

- [x] JSON ? (the program will work with any stable version of JSON)

- [x] Python 3.7.2 (although the program will still run with any version of Python prior to Python 3.0)

- [x] CSS 3.0 (although the program will still run with any version of CSS prior to CSS 2.0 as of 2021 October 28th at 8:00 pm)

- [x] jQuery 1.9.1 (I am unsure whether bumping the version up or down will cause problems)

- [x] BASH shell 5.0 (althouh the program will still run with any version of BASH shell from 3.0 or higher, and it can also be bumped up if needed)
