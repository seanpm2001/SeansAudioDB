### Entry needed: WarZone 2100

I obtained the soundtrack to WarZone 2100 in the past 30 days, and I have not added it to the collection yet. It is an instance in which I can re-upload an entire soundtrack, due to it being public domain.

I am holding back on it for now, as I want to add album art, track descriptions, and other metadata to the files before uploading. The original will remain in tact as well. The original soundtrack can be [found here](https://github.com/Warzone2100/data-music/).

Thinking of it now, I will upload the first half today, but not add the metadata enhanced version until I get to it.
