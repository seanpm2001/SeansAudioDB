# More portable editions of SeansAudioDB

## SD card

##### [/Portable/SD-Card/](/Portable/SD-Card/)

### [SD Card Edition I](/Portable/SD-Card/I/)

This is the first draft for a portable SD card version of my Audio database. It was superceded by [SD Card Edition II](#sd-card-edition-ii) due to size limitations.

### [SD Card Edition II](/Portable/SD-Card/II/)

This is the second draft for a portable SD card version of my Audio database. It was preceded by [SD Card Edition I](#sd-card-edition-i) and features an SD card double the size. It is still being decided on, as of 2022, Wednesday December 21st.

### External/internal hard drive

That is sort of being currently done, but that is not what I mean by portable in this sense.

### External/internal solid state drive

That is currently being done, but that is not what I mean by portable in this sense.

### Floppy disk

### Absolutely not!

- WAY too small (would require tens of thousands of floppy diskettes, and there is no point in that)
- Obsolete format
- Even formats above the 1.44MB floppy disk would be too small, the biggest being a ZIP Drive, which only goes up to 750 megabytes, which would require hundreds of them to be feasible, the requirement of hundreds of zip drives in itself is infeasible.

### Cassette Tape

### Absolutely not!

- WAY too small (would require thousands of cassette tapes, and there is no point in that)
- Obsolete format
- Not enough control of software

### Compact Disc

### Absolutely not!

- WAY too small (would require hundreds of CDs, and that wouldn't be worth it)
- Too much of a hassle
- I don't even have a CD drive on any of my current computers

### DVD

### Absolutely not!

- Too small (would require many DVDs and that wouldn't be worth it)
- Too much of a hassle
- I don't even have a CD/DVD drive on any of my current computers

### Blu-Ray

### Absolutely not!

- Would require multiple discs
- Too much of a hassle
- I don't even have a CD/DVD/Blu-Ray drive on any of my current computers

### USB drive version

May be considered, if there is such thing as a 1 terabyte USB drive that isn't a scam, or isn't just an SD card dongle on a USB peripheral.

### Other formats

Currently unknown
