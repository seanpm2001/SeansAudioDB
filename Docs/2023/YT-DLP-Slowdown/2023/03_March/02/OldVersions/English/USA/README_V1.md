## [2023 / YT-DLP-Slowdown / 03 March / 02](/Docs/2023/YT-DLP-Slowdown/03_March/02/)

A few days ago, I had to update YT-DLP, as it refused to download anything. I don't know whether it was the update or some other factor, but downloads have slowed by nearly 20000% (200x slower)

I don't know how to report this issue. It took me 2 days to download 7.9 GiB of data, when I used to be able to grab over 200 gibibytes in that time.

I am specifically going for YouTube. I am wondering if a recent CEO change caused this. I have yet to test another site. It seems like YT-DLP is going down the road of YouTube-DL. Hopefully it doesn't lead to abandonment.
