## [2023 / Shuffle Problem / 02 February / 02](/Docs/2023/Shuffle-Problem/02_February/02/)

I have hundreds of gigabytes of audio at my disposal, totaling ~1000 hours or more of audio, encompassing nearly every song I have ever heard. You would think that this would be enough. It doesn't feel like it sometimes.

My audio database is stored in a big folder, and I can't shuffle the folder without putting every file in a playlist. This simply isn't possible, as my computer definitely cannot handle a playlist with over 30000 items, and it would take a lot of work (manual or automated) to put everything into a playlist.

I have been feeling like I am low on music lately, but it is more of a problem regarding shuffling. I am wondering if there is some way to get VLC to read from an entire folder, and shuffle, or have some other way of shuffling my existing music.

I am constantly recommended to listen to a radio station, TV music channel, or use a service like Pandora, but I don't want to do either, the latter I can't do because I am strictly against DRM, and I don't use streaming services for music.

This document is a question: is there a way to have VLC read my entire music collection at once (~1 TB, 50000+ files) or what should I do to get the audio to play and shuffle? Please do not recommend proprietary or spyware (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) software as a solution. I am looking for an open source solution.
