## [2023 / Kernel Panic Two / 04_April / 09](/Docs/2023/Kernel-Panic-Two/04_April/09/)

My System76 Pangolin suffered its second kernel panic on 2023, April 8th at around 1:30 am. I contacted System76 later in the day. This crash prevented me from turning the computer back on until the next day, as it refused to boot. Unlike last time, I saved almost everything, so there wasn't much loss from the crash. So why am I mentioning this?

3 of my playlists were unable to be saved due to the kernel panic. I recreated them to the best of my ability on April 8th, but these recreations may not be exact (there might be a few missing songs, and/or the order might be out of date) they are fairly accurate, but they are not perfect carbon copies.

I tried a new strategy the next day, I was hoping that I could just open playlists, and save them periodically as I add new entries. Unfortunately, this cannot be done with VLC Media Player. I abandoned this strategy, as it required manually overwriting the playlist each time, and this proved too tedious.

Also, there were some upload issues with GitHub yesterday. I re-uploaded my 3 playlists several times, as GitHub threw over 10 consecutive errors upon uploading. This is why I gave up on writing the commit description, and why the commit title just says `Add files via upload` I didn't feel like writing it all out again.

Another thing: I previously thought that the audio looping problem on crashing was only a Windows thing. It still occurs on Ubuntu as of Ubuntu 22.04. The last 3 seconds of audio that played prior to the crash kept looping until I hard reset the device. It is still better than 0.1 seconds of audio looping. It will take me a while before I can reopen that file, as I am scared of it now due to the crash.
