## 2023 Video Playback problem in January

Some time near the end of the year in 2022, a program (Firefox) updated on my computer, and it seems to have affected VLC. I tried to play videos, but trying to go out of playlist view caused VLC to go to a black screen and hang, until I closed the current window. I tried this 3 times before determining it just wouldn't work.

So now I can't watch videos on VLC (for the meantime) and this significantly limits my access to my audio database, due to a large amount of content not yet converted to audio only.
