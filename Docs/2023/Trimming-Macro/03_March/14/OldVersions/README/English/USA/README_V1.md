This is a chore and a question:

What is the easiest way to have FFmpeg cut the first 8 seconds out of multiple MP3 files with a single command?

I have been going through the WALLÂ·E soundtrack recently, as I converted it to audio only recently. The source I got it from contains an intro of about 8 to 9 seconds, so each time the song loops, there is lots of silence. I want to create a macro that can cut a certain amount of time out of a batch of files, not just for this soundtrack, but whenever needed. There are 39 MP3 files affected.

How do I achieve this with FFmpeg?

If I succeed on this goal, the script will be placed here:

```c
// Not available yet
```
