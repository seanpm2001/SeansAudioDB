## [2023 / Fast conversion / 03 March / 02](/Docs/2023/Fast-Conversion/03_March/02/)

I have recently noted that my laptop can convert audio much faster than the Raspberry Pi. I initially misjudged that it was about the same speed. I was using my Raspberry Pi as my audio conversion device for a while, but today, I decided that I would rather use my laptop for this job, even though it is taxing on the CPU. I might just remake the playlist on this device and continue audio conversion outside of the Raspberry Pi.

It makes me want to upgrade my CPU, but technology needs to advance first, as I have one of the most powerful types of mid-tier laptops.

I converted nearly 12 hours of audio within 30 minutes today, converting 144 songs into both MP3 (fast conversion) and OGG (slow conversion) so that I could have more songs I could access that don't have video (I still plan to keep the music videos for separate use)
