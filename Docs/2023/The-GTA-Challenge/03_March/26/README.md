## [2023 / The GTA Challenge / 03 March / 26](/Docs/2023/The-GTA-Challenge/03_March/26/)

**Legend:**

- **GTA** = **G**rand **T**heft **A**uto
- XBOX Series X = 2020 console by :: Microsoft
- Blu-Ray = High capacity disk format (up to 250 gigabytes) that succeeds the DVD and CD formats
- Geo-block = Content that is blocked in one country (a VPN can bypass  this)
- Gamepass = Game rental service for the XBOX Series X
- ProtonVPN = VPN service by the creators of ProtonMail

I was going to wait until the next month before making any more posts here. This one is recent, and notable, so I decided to write this article today. There has been a recent challenge in gathering music.

GTA music is going to be a challenge, I have been figuring it out for several days. My dad recently got an XBOX Series X and got GTA (Definitive Edition: GTA III, GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City) GTA 4, and GTA 5. There are hundreds of other games on the XBOX (Gamepass is awesome) although GTA were paid for on physical medium (Blu-Ray) the rest will come later.

The problem with GTA Music is mainly because of the in-game radio. Due to this, there are so many different artists, that common issues arise, including:

1. A compilation video can't include all songs
2. Some content is geo-blocked

These rule out the possibility of downloading them all at once. I might get to make some use of ProtonVPN for the geo-blocked content.

At first, I didn't know what to do. I have adopted the strategy of looking up song listings, and going individually. It took me a few days to decide to do this individually. There was one song I heard in GTA III on 2023, Friday, March 24th that I dug through and found on 2023, Saturday, March 25th (the first song that plays upon entering a car: `Dil-Don't - Summer Stripes`) I am going to slowly go through and find all of the songs and radio tracks. This may take months or years, as I am not doing this constantly.

Right now, I am only going after pre-GTA5 GTA games. GTA 4 and 5 are going to be the most difficult ones.
