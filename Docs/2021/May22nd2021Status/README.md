# May 22nd 2021 update

I have undergone a difficult period in which I was stripped of access to several of my computing resources (most importantly: music, some pictures, and some documents) it started on April 19th 2021 when a Dell repair went wrong and my operating system was unmounted. It is a good thing I had been setting up a backup clone of my laptop since March 31st 2021.

I have gone through numerous efforts to repair and recover the data, and I was able to do so successfully with the help of [Price Computers LLC](http://www.pricecomputersllc.com/) who helped me recover all the data and reinstall the operating system. Huge kudos to them. It would be impossible for me to go on without this fix.

I have recently began to worry about the safety of the data without plugging the hard drive in, and I eventually got the guts to do so, at first finding the data to be possibly corrupt, but later finding out it was all there (the recovered data was placed on a 2 terabyte Western Digital hard drive, formatted with the HFS+ file system. It is a 2 terabyte drive, because the recovery software used duplicated my data, and caused ~900 gigabytes to turn into nearly 1.8 terabytes) further experimentation occurred, and today (Saturday, May 22nd 2021) I have switched back over to my original laptop. I have gotten access back to my music collection, and it has remained stable for multiple days. I also am dealing with software bugs that I know how to fix, and they are occurring less often.

The lesson from this is to never hesitate to backup your laptop before doing a hardware repair, no matter how basic the repair is and how much you trust the person repairing, as things can always go wrong (I was told my laptop lacked a CMOS battery, which supposedly corrupted a part of the BIOS/bootloader when the keyboard was replaced)
