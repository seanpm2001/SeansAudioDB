# Spotify for Ubuntu/Linux (2021 October 12th discovery)

I accidentally open the Ubuntu software store from time to time. Today was one of those days. That being said, the date of MY discovery of this knowledge was 2021 October 12th, Spotify may have been on Linux longer than this.

When I opened the store today, I noticed a banner promoting Spotify. My only criticism of the banner is that the text in the middle should have been white, instead of black, as it is really hard to read it on this color palette.

I am not sure if this is good for Linux or if it is detrimental. It is just proprietary software, which generally isn't good, but it is something that a lot of people use. I personally don't use it, but its developers ported the software to Linux in "a labor of love" so now we have another top Windows software piece on Linux. The preview isn't letting me see screenshots (other programs let me see them, so it isn't an error on my end) the error on my end is that I am not able to see reviews on anything. I am not going to install it though, and it is being claimed that Linux still isn't an officially supported Spotify platform.

I don't know what to say exactly yet. - 2021 October 13th (this was written 1 day later)
