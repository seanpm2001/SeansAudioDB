# Late April 2021 YouTube-dl issue

YouTube-dl has not been working properly on my cloned laptop, so I am waiting for it to become functional again/looking for an alternative. There are a few videos that haven't been noted yet that I want to get (not just music)

Notable alternatives I am considering include `pytube`
