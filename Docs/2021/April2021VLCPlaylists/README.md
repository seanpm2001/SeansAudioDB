# Late April 2021 VLC Playlists

If anyone is paying attention to this repository (other than me) right now (along with future reference) you may have noticed nothing but blank VLC playlists since April 19th 2021. I will give some background, I haven't said anything in too long.

Recently, Dell came to repair my laptops keyboard. In the process, the motherboard lost power, and my laptop became unbootable, immediately dropping to a shell (BusyBox) the laptop repairman was a hardware person and was unable to help (Dell, if you are reading this, please **DO NOT FIRE THIS EMPLOYEE** it isn't his fault, and he was very nice and got what he needed to do done (he repaired the keyboard in less than 45 minutes, taking the entire laptop apart and re-assmebling it) what you can do is help give me better advice after being on call for an hour than "format your operating system and lose all files or reach out to a 3rd party" if you have any UNIX/Linux repair workers, you can send one instead) Hopefully this doesn't come off as an offense, it is hard to tell the tone over a digital connection.

I haven't been able to use my main laptop for nearly 2 weeks, so I have been using an emergency backup, which is a near clone of the laptop that got formatted. Unfortunately, it is not a complete clone, and it comes with its own problems. The thing that is upsetting is that VLC was rooted as the cause of constant system crashes, and I had limited music anyways, so I had to switch back to no music (listening through a browser isn't an option either) I have found VLC for Android to be incredibly useful, and I have been using it instead. I have had crashes still, but they aren't related to VLC.

So lately, I have just been copying the 3 blank playlists and using them as templates to keep the trend going, simply copying them and renaming them. This is what has been going on.
