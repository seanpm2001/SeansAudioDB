# Reaching out

Recently, I have found someone online who has a similar audio goal as me. I found them via the [r/ipod subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/) via [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/t29xpo/they_said_it_couldnt_or_shouldnt_be_done_but_i/)

The post in question is also interesting, as this person managed to transform a classic (pre-iPod Touch era) iPod into a device with a 1 terabyte capacity. These devices usually only came with 512 megabytes of storage, this person managed to increase this by 2000x

I am still working on reaching out to them. The similarity they share with me is that they plan to collect music they have heard over their lifetime. The scope of this seems to be a lot smaller though.
