## 2023 November 8th

I have a new playlist naming scheme, it changed in the past 2 weeks, where the ***NighttimeWebsite*** playlist was renamed to just ***Nighttime***. Before todays change, the time of the exports has remained on an undocumented accepted time scheme of before 4:00 pm (playlist 1) between 4:00 pm and 9:00 pm (playlist 2) and after 9:00 pm (playlist 3) tonight, I made it even more consistent, renaming ***AfternoonJournal*** to ***Afternoon*** and ***AfternoonWebsite*** to ***Evening***. I also changed the times, going to a slightly changed scheme of before 5:00 pm (afternoon) between 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm (evening) and after 9:00 pm (nighttime) I might put a morning playlist into the mix in the future.
