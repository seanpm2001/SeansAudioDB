# Frequently asked questions

I haven't gotten too many questions yet, so I added some that I assume people will ask.

# GitHub releases

Where is the audio?
-----------

The audio is the biggest part of this database. The database index ties it all together and works with it. However, there are 2 major reasons why I can't upload the audio:

> 1. Copyright

> * I can't upload most of the music to GitHub due to copyright reasons. 

> 2. GitHub 100 Gigabyte repository limit

> * Even if copyright wasn't an issue, I would still exceed the 100 Gigabyte repository limit on GitHub, as the audio collection takes up over 205 gigabytes in total.

This is one of the most important things, but it can't be added. Maybe if the copyrighted materials go into the public domain soon, and GitHub increases repository size, I may upload it, but I still fear that we are reaching the limits of Moore's law.

Why do you put your full name out there?
-----------

I feel like when I succeed in life, I should put my full name out there. I am an adult now and I can make my own decisions. My name will get out there anyway.

What is the Life Archive project?
-----------

The life archive project is a project I do where I archive every element of my life. The audio system is located in the root of the "extras" of the archive, and its sole purpose is to archive every song I have ever listened to, along with sound effects. This may seem like an impossible goal, but in just 2 years, I have managed to get over 80% completion on this (out of over 19 years of progress) the only problems I currently have are with finding sound effects.

Why do you use Firefox to test and no other browsers?
-----------

I personally only use Firefox, because it is faster, more customizable, and privacy oriented. It is also a really helpful browser. Since this is a personal project, it should be tested on personal projects. Since I mainly use Firefox, I should test the project in that. The public version is planned to be tested in as many browsers as possible.

# Local releases

Do you even listen to the music?
-----------

Yes, I listen to my music on a daily basis. It really helps me work. I cycle through thousands of songs, as I have a mental system where I can listen to certain songs a certain number of times before I have to switch to another song. The collection is large enough so that I will always have enough to listen to.

Why don't you just use Pandora, or other online music services?
-----------

I like having an offline collection. When I go on trips with my laptop, I would rather have a physical copy with me. Plus, when I try streaming services, they don't offer the same content, and even then, they don't feel the same. Some pros of my collection is that I can modify how audio sounds as well, which can't be done with every online platform that I know of.
