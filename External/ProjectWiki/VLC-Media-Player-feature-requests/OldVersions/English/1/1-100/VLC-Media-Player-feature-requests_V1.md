# VLC Media Player feature requests

This is a list of feature requests I have for VLC Media Player to keep it as the best media player.

## Album art

1. There should be an option to remove album art/set it to the default image again

## Interface

1. There should be an optional set of options to emulate the mobile VLC interface. The 2 versions are almost entirely different products, so there is a lot to go over here:

* A dark mode/light mode toggle + a daylight/night toggle

* An option to enable/disable parsing media

* An album view for all your albums

> * Changable size of albums

> * Sorting options (A-Z, Z-A, quantity+, quantity-, etc.)

> * Choose what shows up

* An artists tab

> * Sorting options

* A tracks tab

* A Genres tab

> * Sorting options (A-Z, Z-A, quantity+, quantity-, etc.)

* A history tab

Until then, I might have to use an Android virtual machine for VLC at times, when I get the resources.

## Genre

1. There should be an option to have comma separated values for Genres, as when I put multiple genres (example: pop, rock) it groups `pop, rock` as its own entry, rather than `pop` and `rock` being separate entries. It gets really out of hand when you have hundreds of different genres, and each file is different

## Image support

VLC poorly supports image viewing. Since an image is a type of media, images should be playable in VLC, including:

- * PNG

- * JPG

- * JPEG

- * GIF

- * SVG

- * BMP

- * TIF

- * TIFF

- * JFIF

- * JIF

- * ICO

- * WIM

- * WebP

- * PSD

- * WMF

- * PNS

- * QT

- * APNG

- * DIB

- * JP2

- * Other

and more. This is the lowest entry on my list, as it may be a problem for VLC to replace image viewers.
