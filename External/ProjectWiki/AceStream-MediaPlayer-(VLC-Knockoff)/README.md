Ace Stream Player is a ripoff of VLC Media Player that reskinned VLC and made it closed source, and added different branding to its name. The term `(VLC)` is still visible in the title bar.

This software tries to get around being a ripoff by adding in BitTorrent functionality. It is still not worth it over traditional VLC, as:

1. It is a ripoff of VLC and violates VideoLans creation, basically plagiarism

2. It is closed source software, meaning you can't see what it is doing

3. Some users indicate that the software is malware

I am not sure why Canonical/The Snapcrafters keep featuring this in their store, it is straight up plagiarism, and is not ok.
