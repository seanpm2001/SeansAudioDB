# Articles to write (SeansAudioDB Wiki)

<!-- TODO ![]() What should the image be? !-->

I have recently noted the importance of the project Wiki last month (2021 September), and worked heavily on the Wiki for the [WacOS project](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/) and I plan to do the same here, just with a different subject.

<!-- This project has become a strong Apple Wiki, and it expands outside the scope of just WacOS. Articles should still be based on WacOS when possible, but also contain info on Apple - 2021 Saturday September 18th !-->

**Articles to write:** `184` _(this number will continue to go up over time, as more topics are found during research)_

**Articles written so far:** `18` / `184` (10.22%) _Note: the homepage, footer, and sidebar are also included in this count._

**Stats are as of 2021, Tuesday, November 9th at 7:53 pm**

**Total entries:** `184` **Completed:** `18` _(as the footer, homepage, and sidebar are counted)_

**Current completion status (as of 2021 Tuesday, November 9th at 7:53 pm):** `10.22%`

<details>
	<summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the total percentage estimate mathematical formula</p></summary>

**Percent complete calculation formula:** `completed` `y` `/` `total` `x` _=_ `answer`, **or** `y` `/` `x`

( `completed` == `y` | `total` == `x` | `answer` == `sum` )

**Important notes:**

`don't let the decimal confuse you`

`don't divide x by y, instead divide y by x`

`if your calculator puts zeroes before the decimal, that is a normal calculator. Pretend that the number 10-99 comes after the 0, and once it passes 99.99, it goes to 100.00` (I don't know how to explain this better)

</details>

**Other notes (not related to the formula)**

_I just keep adding to this list, as I keep finding new entries. It seems for every 1-5 entries I complete, 10-30 get added to the todo list._

## How to make your own checklist in Markdown

<details>
	<summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the section that tells you how to make your own Markdown checklist</p></summary>

```markdown
- [ ]
```

is equal to:

- [ ]

```markdown
- [x]
```

is equal to:

- [x]

```markdown
- [ ] Foo

- [x] Bar
```

is equal to:

- [ ] Foo

- [x] Bar

Alternatively, this works:

```markdown
- [ ] Foo
- [x] Bar
```

Note the lack of a blank line between each box. I choose to add the blank line, as some of my markdown viewers (including the one on GitHub in some spots) have problems if I don't separate things with spaces, and will format like this:

```markdown
- [ ] Foo-[x] Bar
```

**Total entries:** `3` **Completed:** `0`

**Current completion status (as of 2021 Thursday, October 7th at 6:25 pm):** `00.00%` (formula: completed(y) / total(x) = answer, or y / x, don't let the decimal confuse you)
