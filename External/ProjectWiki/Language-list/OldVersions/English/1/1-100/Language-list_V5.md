Note: the origin country of the composer is not counted in this count, as it wouldn't make sense. So Bach music isn't counted as German, even though the origin was Germany/a German composer, it is counted as "any" as it is ambient/instrumental music.

**Translated using [Bing Translate](https://www.bing.com/Translator/), entries marked with `(cannot translate, not supported)` couldn't be translated, as Bing translate didn't support them at the time of translation.**
