# Language list

My music and sound effect collection features audio in the following languages:

**This list is sorted A-Z**

**Language count:** `25/26`

* Arabic (العربية)

* Any (for ambient/no vocal audio) (most common)

* Bulgarian (Български)

* Chinese (中文 / 中文)

* Danish (Dansk)

* English (English) (2nd most common)

* Finnish (Suomi)

* French (Français)

* German (Deutsch)

* Hawaiian (cannot translate, not supported)

* Icelandic (Íslenska)

* Japanese (日本語)

* Korean (North) (cannot translate, not supported) (rarest, only used in 1 song) 

* Korean (South) (한국(남부))

* Latin (cannot translate, not supported)

* Mongolian (modern, Cyrillic) (cannot translate, not supported)

* Persian (فارسی)

* Polish (Polski)

* Punjabi (ਪੰਜਾਬੀ)

Note: the origin country of the composer is not counted in this count, as it wouldn't make sense. So Bach music isn't counted as German, even though the origin was Germany/a German composer, it is counted as "any" as it is ambient/instrumental music.

**Translated using [Bing Translate](https://www.bing.com/Translator/), entries marked with `(cannot translate, not supported)` couldn't be translated, as Bing translate didn't support them at the time of translation.**
