# General (media information)

![https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/blob/master/Graphics/VLC/Media-Information/Sample/Sample-Song-VLC-Media-Information_LightMode_1080p.png](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/blob/master/Graphics/VLC/Media-Information/Sample/Sample-Song-VLC-Media-Information_LightMode_1080p.png)

To view the general information (media information) for a song, go to `Tools` > `Media information`

This information panel shows off the media information metadata for the video or audio file. It is most common with audio files, I have not tested to see if it works on video files.

Under the general section, you will see these. You can additionally view extra metadata in the `Metadata` tab, view the codecs under the `Codec` tab, or view the statistics in the `Statistics` tab. This article only goes over the `General` tab. I will write articles in the future on these other tabs

## Album art

Right clicking this icon will allow you to set/remove album art for the particular file. You can also download it, but I am not sure if it actually works under the snap version of VLC. You can learn additional info [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/wiki/Album-art-collection/)
