# Features of VLC

VLC has many, many features. I will only go over the most unique ones first.

## Cool features

VLC can be used to make videos and images into puzzles in real time (you can solve a 4-256 piece puzzle while the video is still playing)

* To try this out, go to: `Tools` > `Effects and filters` > `Video effects` > `Geometry` > `Puzzle game`

VLC can be used to stream and download videos from YouTube and other video sites

* Tutorial currently unavailable

You can adjust the pitch in a video to make it deeper or higher, and unlock many combinations to an audio/video+audio file.

* To try this out, go to: `Tools` > `Effects and filters` > `Audio effects` > `Advanced` > `Adjust pitch`

VLC can be used as a video editor - I need better confirmation on this.

## Notes

I am in a bit of a rush, so I will work on this more later.
