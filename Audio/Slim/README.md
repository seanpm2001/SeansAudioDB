##### Music/Slim/README.md

## Slim I

Slim I is a new iteration of my audio collection designed to take up much less space, and be easier on CPU and battery. The goal is to remain below 400 gigabytes, preferably 128 gigabytes and below.

### Slim 1.0A

Designed to take up much less space, but still take up some space. Changes:

All songs will be in audio format. No extended versions will be available in video format. If a music video is associated with a song, it will be included separately.

#### Collections

- [x] 1 Music

- [x] 2 Music (projectless)

- [x] 3 Sound effects

### Slim 1.0B

Designed to take up much less space, but still take up some space. Changes:
